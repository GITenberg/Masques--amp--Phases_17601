DEDICATION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Child</span>,</p>
<p>It is not often the privilege of a contributor to address his former
editor in so fatherly a fashion; yet it is appropriate because you justified
an old proverb in becoming, if I may say so, my literary parent.&nbsp;
Though I had enjoyed the hospitality, I dare not say the welcome, of
more than one London editor, you were the first who took off the bearing-rein
from my frivolity.&nbsp; You allowed me that freedom, of manner and
matter, which I have only experienced in undergraduate periodicals.&nbsp;
It is not any lack of gratitude to such distinguished editors as the
late Mr. Henley; or Mr. Walter Pollock, who first accorded me the courtesies
of print in a periodical not distinguished for its courtesy; or Professor
C. J. Holmes, who has occasionally endured me with patience in the <i>Burlington
Magazine</i>; or Mr. Edmund Gosse, to whom I <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>am
under special obligations; that I address myself particularly to you.&nbsp;
But I, who am not frightened of many things, have always been frightened
of editors.&nbsp; I am filled with awe when I think of the ultramarine
pencil that is to delete my ultramontane views.&nbsp; You were, as I
have hinted, the first to abrogate its use in my favour.&nbsp; When
you, if not Consul, were at least Plancus, I think the only thing you
ever rejected of mine was an essay entitled &lsquo;Editors, their Cause
and Cure.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is not included, for obvious reasons, in the
present volume, of which you will recognise most of the contents.&nbsp;
These may seem even to your indulgent eyes a trifle miscellaneous and
disconnected.&nbsp; Still there is a thread common to all, though I
cannot claim for them uniformity.&nbsp; There is no strict adherence
to those artificial divisions of literature into fiction, essay, criticism,
and poetry.&nbsp; Count Tolstoy, however, has shown us that a novel
may be an essay rather than a story.&nbsp; No less a writer than Swift
used the medium of fiction for his most brilliant criticism of life;
his fables, apart from their satire, are often mere essays.&nbsp; Plato,
Sir Thomas More, <!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>William
Morris, and Mr. H. G. Wells have not disdained to transmit their philosophy
under the domino of romance or myth.&nbsp; Some of the greatest poets&mdash;Ruskin
and Pater for example&mdash;have chosen prose for their instrument of
expression.&nbsp; If that theory is true of literature&mdash;and I ask
you to accept it as true&mdash;how much truer is it of journalism, at
least such journalism as mine; though I see a great gulf between literature
and journalism far greater than that between fiction and essay-writing.&nbsp;
The line, too, dividing the poetry of Keats from the prose of Sir Thomas
Browne is far narrower, in my opinion, than the line dividing Pope from
Tennyson.&nbsp; And I say this mindful of Byron&rsquo;s scornful couplet
and the recent animadversions of Lord Morley.</p>
<p>There are essays in my book cast in the form of fiction; criticism
cast in the form of parody; and a vein of high seriousness sufficiently
obvious, I hope, behind the masques and phases of my jesting.&nbsp;
The psychological effects produced by works of art and arch&aelig;ology,
by drama and books, on men and situations&mdash;such are the themes
of these passing observations.</p>
<p><!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>And
though you find them like an old patchwork quilt I hope you will laugh,
in token of your acceptance, if not of the book at least of my lasting
regard and friendship for yourself.</p>
<p>Ever yours,<br />

CASE AT THE MUSEUM.</h2>
<p>It is a common error to confuse the arch&aelig;ologist with the mere
collector of ignoble trifles, equally pleased with an unusual postage
stamp or a scarce example of an Italian primitive.&nbsp; Nor should
the impertinent curiosity of local antiquaries, which sees in every
disused chalk-pit traces of Roman civilisation, be compared with the
rare predilection requisite for a nobler pursuit.&nbsp; The arch&aelig;ologist
preserves for us those objects which time has forgotten and passing
fashion rejected; in the museums he buries our ancient eikons, where
they become impervious to neglect, praise, or criticism; while the collector&mdash;a
malicious atavist unless he possess accidental perceptions&mdash;merely
rescues the mistakes of his forefathers, to crowd public galleries with
an inconsequent lumber which a better taste has taught as to despise.</p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>In
the magic of escaped conventions surely none is more powerful than the
Greek, and even now, though we yawn over the enthusiasm of the Renaissance
mirrored in our more cadenced prose, there are some who can still catch
the delightful contagion which seized the princes and philosophers of
Europe in that Martin&rsquo;s Summer of Middle Age.</p>
<p>Of the New Learning already become old, Professor Lachsyrma is reputed
a master.&nbsp; Scarcely any one in England holds a like position.&nbsp;
He is sixty, and, though his youth is said to have been eventful, he
hardly looks his age.&nbsp; He speaks English with a delightful accent,
and there always hangs about his presence a melancholy halo of mystery
and Italy.&nbsp; His quiet unassumed familiarity with every museum and
library on the Continent astonishes even the most erudite Teuton.&nbsp;
Among arch&aelig;ologists he is thought a pre-eminent pal&aelig;ographer,
among pal&aelig;ographers a great arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp; I have heard
him called the Furtw&auml;ngler of Britain.&nbsp; His facsimiles and
collated texts of the classics are familiar throughout the world.&nbsp;
He has independent <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>means,
and from time to time entertains English and foreign <i>cognoscenti</i>
with elegant simplicity at his wonderful house in Kensington.&nbsp;
His conversation is more informing than brilliant.&nbsp; Yet you may
detect an unaccountable melancholy in his voice and manner, attributed
by the irreverent to his constant visits to the Museum.&nbsp; Religious
people, of course, refer to his loss of faith at Oxford; for I regret
to say the Professor has been an habitual freethinker these many years.</p>
<p>However it may be, Professor Lachsyrma is sad, and has not yet issued
his edition of the newly discovered poems of Sappho unearthed in Egypt
some time since&mdash;an edition awaited so impatiently by poets and
scholars.</p>
<p>Some years ago, on retiring from his official appointment, Professor
Lachsyrma, being a married man, searched for some apartment remote from
his home, where he might work undisturbed at labours long since become
important pleasures.&nbsp; You cannot grapple with uncials, cursives,
and the like in a domestic environment.&nbsp; The preparation of facsimiles,
transcripts, and pal&aelig;ographical observations, reports of excavations
and <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>catalogues,
demands isolation and complete immunity from the trivialities of social
existence.</p>
<p>In a large Bloomsbury studio he found a retreat suitable to his requirements.&nbsp;
The uninviting entrance, up a stone staircase leading immediately from
the street, was open till nightfall, the rest of the house being used
for storage by second-hand dealers in Portland Street.&nbsp; No one
slept on the premises, but a caretaker came at stated intervals to light
fires and close the front door; for which, however, the Professor owned
a pass-key, each room having, as in modern flats, an independent door
that might be locked at pleasure.&nbsp; The general gloom of the building
never tempted casual callers.&nbsp; The Professor purposely abstained
from the decoration or even ordinary furnishing of his chamber.&nbsp;
The whitewashed walls were covered with dust-bitten maps, casts of bas-reliefs,
engravings of ruins.&nbsp; Behind the door were stacked huge packing-cases
containing the harvest of a recent journey to the eastern shores of
the Mediterranean.&nbsp; Along one wall mutilated statues and torsos
were promiscuously mounted on trestles or temporary <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>pedestals
made of inverted wooden boxes.&nbsp; Above them a large series of shelves
bulging with folios, manuscript notebooks, pamphlets, and catalogues
ran up to the window, which faced north-east, admitting a strong top-light
through panes of ground glass; the lower sash was hidden by permanent
blinds in order to shut out all view of the opposite houses and the
street below.&nbsp; A long narrow table occupied the centre of the room.&nbsp;
It was always strewn with magnifying-glasses, proofs, printers&rsquo;
slips, negatives&mdash;the litter of a pal&aelig;ographic student.&nbsp;
There were three or four wooden chairs for the benefit of scholarly
friends, and an armchair upholstered in green rep near the stove.&nbsp;
In a corner stood the most striking, perhaps the only striking, object
in the room&mdash;a huge mummy from the Fayy&ucirc;m.&nbsp; The canopic
jars and outer coffins belonging to it were still unpacked in the freight
cases.&nbsp; It had been purchased from a bankrupt Armenian dealer in
Cairo along with a number of Gr&aelig;co-Egyptian antiquities and papyri,
of far greater interest to the Professor than the mummy itself.&nbsp;
As soon as the interior was examined it was to be presented to the Museum;
but more <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>entertaining
and important studies delayed its removal.&nbsp; For many months, with
a curious grave smile, the face on the shell seemed to look down with
amused and permanent interest on Professor Lachsyrma struggling with
the orthography of some forgotten scribe, and arguing with a friend
on mutilated or corrupt passages in a Greek palimpsest.</p>
<p>Here, late one afternoon, Professor Lachsyrma was deciphering some
yellow leaves of papyrus.&nbsp; The dusk was falling, and he laid down
the pen with which he was delicately transcribing uncials on sheets
of foolscap, in order to light a lamp on the table.&nbsp; It was 6.30
by an irritating little American clock recently presented him by one
of his children, noisy symbol and only indication that he held commune
with a modern life he so heartily despised.&nbsp; As the housekeeper
entered with some tea he took up a copy of a morning paper (a violent
transition from uncials), and glanced at the first lines of the leader:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Trustees of the British Museum announce one of the
most sensational literary discoveries in recent years, a discovery which
must startle the world of scholars, and even the apathetic public at
large.&nbsp; This <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>is
none other than the recovery of the long-lost poems of Sappho, manuscripts
of which were last heard of in the tenth century, when they were burnt
at Rome and Byzantium.&nbsp; We shall have to go back to the fifteenth
century, to the Fall of Constantinople, to the Revival of Learning,
ere we can find a fitting parallel to match the importance of this recent
find.&nbsp; Not since the spade of the excavator uncovered from its
shroud of earth the flawless beauty of the Olympian Hermes has such
a delightful acquisition been made to our knowledge of Greek literature.&nbsp;
The name of Professor Lachsyrma has long been one to conjure with, and
all of us should experience pleasure (where surprise in his case is
out of the question) on learning that his recent tour to Egypt, besides
greatly benefiting his health, was the means of restoring to eager posterity
one of the most precious monuments of Hellenic culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me, I had no idea the press could be so entertaining,&rsquo;
thought the Professor, as a smile of satisfaction spread over his well-chiselled
face.&nbsp; Arch&aelig;ologists are not above reading personal paragraphs
and leaders about themselves, though current events do not interest
them.&nbsp; So absorbing is their pursuit of antiquity that they are
obliged to affect a plausible indifference and a refined ignorance about
modern affairs.&nbsp; Nor are they very <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>generous
members of the community.&nbsp; Perhaps dealing in dead gods, perpetually
handling precious objects which have ceased to have any relation to
life, or quarrelling about languages no one ever uses, blunts their
sensibilities.&nbsp; At all events, they have none of that loyalty distinguishing
members of other learned professions.&nbsp; The canker of jealousy eats
perpetually at their hearts.</p>
<p>Professor Lachsyrma was too well endowed by fortune to grudge his
former colleagues their little incomes or inadequate salaries at the
Museum.&nbsp; Still, his recent discovery would not only enhance his
fame in the learned world and his reputed <i>flair</i> for manuscripts&mdash;it
would irritate those rivals in England and Germany who, in the more
solemn reviews, resisted some of his conclusions, canvassed his facts,
and occasionally found glaring errors in his texts.&nbsp; How jealous
the discovery would make young Fairleigh, for all his unholy knowledge
of Greek vases, his handsome profile, and his predilection for going
too frequently into society!&mdash;a taste not approved by other officials.&nbsp;
How it would anger old Gully!&nbsp; Professor Lachsyrma drank some more
tea with further satisfaction.&nbsp; <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Sappho
herself could not have felt more elated on the completion of one of
her odes; we know she was poignant and sensitive.&nbsp; Thus for a whole
hour he idled with his thoughts&mdash;rare occupation for so industrious
a man.&nbsp; He was startled from the reverie by a slight knock at his
door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; he said coldly.&nbsp; There was a touch of
annoyance in his tone.&nbsp; Visitors, frequent enough in the morning,
rarely disturbed him in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To whom have I the&mdash;duty of speaking?&rsquo;&nbsp; He
raised his well-preserved spare form to its full height.&nbsp; The long
loose alpaca coat, velvet skull-cap, and pointed beard gave him the
appearance of an eminent ecclesiastic.</p>
<p>The subdued light in the room presented only a dim figure on the
threshold, and the piercing eyes of the Professor could only see a blurred
white face against the black frame of the open door.&nbsp; A strange
voice replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to disturb you, Professor Lachsyrma.&nbsp; I shall
not detain you for more than&mdash;an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will kindly write and state the nature of your business,
I can give you an <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>appointment
to-morrow or the day after.&nbsp; At the present moment, you will observe,
I am busy.&nbsp; I never see visitors except by appointment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to inconvenience you.&nbsp; Necessity compels me
to choose my own hours for interviewing any one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Professor then suddenly removed the green cardboard shade from
the lamp.&nbsp; The discourteous intruder was now visible for his inspection.</p>
<p>He was a fair man of uncertain age, but could not be more than twenty-eight.&nbsp;
He wore his flaxen hair rather long and ill-kempt; his face might have
been handsome, but the flesh was white and flaccid; the features, though
regular, devoid of character; the blue eyes had so little expression
that a professed physiognomist would have found difficulty in &lsquo;placing&rsquo;
their possessor.&nbsp; His black clothes were shiny with age; his gait
was shuffling and awkward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name, though it will not convey very much to you, is Frank
Carrel.&nbsp; I am a scholar, an arch&aelig;ologist, a pal&aelig;ographer,
and&mdash;other things besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>&lsquo;A
beggar and a British Museum reader,&rsquo; was the mental observation
of the Professor.&nbsp; The other seemed to read his thoughts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think I want pecuniary assistance; well, I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear you have come to the wrong person, at the wrong time,
and if I may say so, in the wrong way.&nbsp; I do not like to be disturbed
at this hour.&nbsp; Will you kindly leave me this instant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Carrel&rsquo;s manner changed and became more deferential.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will allow me to show you something on which I want
your opinion, something I can leave with you, I will go away at once
and come back to-morrow at any time you name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the Professor, wearily, ready to compromise
the matter for the moment.</p>
<p>From a small bag he was carrying Carrel produced a roll of papyrus.&nbsp;
The Professor&rsquo;s eyes gleamed; he held out his hands greedily to
receive it, fixing a searching, suspicious glance on Carrel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did you get this, may I ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>&lsquo;I
want your opinion first, and then I will tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Professor moved towards the lamp, replaced the cardboard green
shade, sat down, and with a strong magnifying-glass examined the papyrus
with evident interest.&nbsp; Carrel, appreciating the interest he was
exciting, talked on in rapid jerky sentences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I think you will be able to help me.&nbsp; I am
sure you will do so.&nbsp; Like yourself, I am a scholar, and might
have occupied a position in Europe similar to your own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Professor smiled grimly, but did not look up from the table as
Carrel continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine has been a strange career.&nbsp; I was educated abroad.&nbsp;
I became a scholar at Cambridge.&nbsp; There was no prize I did not
carry off.&nbsp; I knew more Greek than both Universities put together.&nbsp;
Then I was cursed not only with inclination for vices, but with capacity
and courage to practise them&mdash;liquor, extravagance, gambling&mdash;amusements
for rich people; but I was poor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a very sad and a very common story,&rsquo; said the
Professor sententiously, but without looking up from the table.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I myself was an <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Oxford
man.&nbsp; Your name is quite unfamiliar to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fancy if you asked them at Cambridge they would certainly
remember me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall make a point of doing so,&rsquo; said the professor
drily.&nbsp; He affected to be giving only partial attention to the
narrative; but though he seemed to be sedulous in his examination of
the papyrus, he was listening intently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was a great disappointment to the Dons,&rsquo; Carrel said
with a short laugh, and he lit a cigarette with all the swagger of an
undergraduate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to your parents?&rsquo; queried Lachsyrma.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mother was dead.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t exactly know who my
father was.&nbsp; I fear these details bore you, however.&nbsp; To-morrow&mdash;&rsquo;
he added satirically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very romantic story, no doubt,&rsquo; said the Professor,
rising from his chair, &lsquo;and it interests me&mdash;moderately;
but before we go on any further, I will be candid with you.&nbsp; That
papyrus is a forgery&mdash;a very clever forgery, too.&nbsp; I wonder
why the writer tried Euripides; we have almost enough of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>&lsquo;So
do I sometimes,&rsquo; returned Carrel cheerfully.&nbsp; The Professor
arched his eyebrows in surprise.</p>
<p>He removed the green cardboard lampshade to keep his equivocal visitor
under strict observation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you knew it was a forgery, why did you waste my time and
your own in bringing it here?&nbsp; In order to tell me a long story
about yourself, which if true is extraordinarily dull?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is almost an established convention for experts to be rude when
they have given an adverse opinion on anything submitted to them.&nbsp;
It gives weight to their statements.&nbsp; In the present case, however,
the Professor was really annoyed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted to know if you recognised the papyrus,&rsquo; said
Carrel, and he smiled disingenuously.&nbsp; The Professor was startled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; it was offered to me in Cairo last winter by a German
dealer in antiquities.&nbsp; I recognised it at once.&nbsp; May I felicitate
the talented author?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; You would have been taken in if I were the author.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Professor
Lachsyrma waved a white hand, loaded with scarabs and gems, in a deprecatory,
patronising manner towards Carrel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must apologise if I have wronged you.&nbsp; I am hardened
to these little amenities between brother pal&aelig;ographers.&nbsp;
Envy, jealousy, call it what you will, attacks those in high places.&nbsp;
There may be unrecognised artists, mute inglorious Miltons, Chattertons,
starving in garrets, Shakespeares in the workhouse, while dull modern
productions are applauded on the silly English stage, and poetasters
are crowned by the Academies; but believe me that in Arch&aelig;ology,
in the deciphering of manuscripts, the quack is detected immediately.&nbsp;
The science has been carried to such a state of perfection that, if
our knowledge is still unhappily imperfect, our materials inadequate,
the public recognition of our services quite out of proportion to our
labours, there is now no permanent place for the charlatan or the forger.&nbsp;
The first would do better as an art critic for the daily papers; the
other might turn his attention to the simple necessary cheque, or the
safer and more enticing Bank of England <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>note.&nbsp;
If you are an honest expert, there is a wide field for your talents;
and if I do not believe you to be anything of the kind, you have yourself
to blame for my scepticism.&nbsp; You came here without an introduction,
without any warning of your arrival.&nbsp; You refuse to leave my room.&nbsp;
You inform me that you want money with a candour unusual among beggars.&nbsp;
You then ask me to inspect a forged manuscript which you either know
or suspect me to have seen before.&nbsp; Should you have no explanation
to offer for this outrageous intrusion, may I ask you to leave the premises
immediately?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he finished this somewhat pompous harangue he pointed menacingly
towards the door.&nbsp; He was slightly nervous, for Carrel, who was
sitting down, remained seated, his hands folded, gazing up with an insolent
childish stare.&nbsp; He might have been listening to an eloquent preacher
whom he thoroughly despised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Professor Lachsyrma,&rsquo; Carrel said in a sweet winning
voice, &lsquo;I will go away if you like now, but I have nearly finished
my errand and we may as well dispatch an affair tiresome <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>to
both of us, this evening, instead of postponing it.&nbsp; I want you
to give me 1000<i>l</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Professor rubbed his eyes.&nbsp; Was he dreaming?&nbsp; Was this
some elaborate practical joke?&nbsp; Was it the confidence trick?&nbsp;
He seemed to lose his self-possession, gaped on Carrel for some seconds,
then controlled himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why should I give you 1000<i>l</i>.?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a blackmailer.&nbsp; I am a forger of manuscripts.&nbsp;
I have more Greek in my little finger than you have in your long body.&nbsp;
I began to tell you my history.&nbsp; I thought it might interest you.&nbsp;
I do not propose to burden you with it any further.&nbsp; To-night I
ask you for 1000<i>l</i>., to-morrow I shall ask you for 2000<i>l</i>.,
and the day after&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Sibyl was scarcely so extortionate when she offered the
Tarquin literary wares that no subsequent research with which I am acquainted
has proved to be spurious.&nbsp; And you, Mr. Carrel, offer me forgeries&mdash;merely
forgeries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fear expressed itself in clumsy satire.&nbsp; He was thoroughly alarmed.&nbsp;
He began rapidly to review his own antecedents, and to scrape <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>his
memory for discreditable incidents.&nbsp; He could think of nothing
he need feel ashamed of, nothing the world might not thoroughly investigate.&nbsp;
There were mean actions, but many generous ones to balance in the scale.</p>
<p>His knowledge of life was really slight, as his intimacy with Arch&aelig;ology
(so he told himself) was profound.&nbsp; One foolish incident, a midsummer
madness, before he went to Oxford, was all he had to blush for.&nbsp;
This, he frequently confessed, not without certain pride, to his wife,
the daughter of a respectable man of letters from Massachusetts.&nbsp;
He firmly and privately believed an omission in a catalogue a far greater
sin than a breach of the Decalogue.&nbsp; But ethics are of little consequence
where conduct is above reproach.&nbsp; When buying antiquities he would
come across odd people from time to time, but never any one who openly
avowed himself a blackmailer and a forger.&nbsp; The novel experience
was embarrassing and unpleasant, but there was really little to fear.&nbsp;
In all the delight of a clear conscience, since Carrel vouchsafed no
reply to his sardonic Sibylline allusion, he said:</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>&lsquo;You
have advanced no reason why I should hand you to-day or to-morrow these
modest sums you demand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I will tell you,&rsquo; said Carrel, standing up suddenly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I fabricated the poems of Sappho,&mdash;yes, the manuscript from
which <i>you</i> are reaping so much credit&rsquo;&mdash;he took up
the newspaper&mdash;&lsquo;from the morning press.&nbsp; When I take
to art criticism, as you kindly suggested a dishonest man might do,
it will be of a livelier description than any to which you are usually
accustomed.&nbsp; Vain dupe, you think yourself impeccable.&nbsp; Infallible
ass, there is hardly a museum in Europe where my manuscripts are not
carefully preserved for the greatest and rarest treasures by senile
curators, too ignorant to know their errors or too vain to acknowledge
them.&nbsp; I fancied you clever; until now I do not know that I ever
caught you out, though you may have bought many of my wares for all
I know.&nbsp; I find you, however, like the rest&mdash;dull, pedantic,
and Pecksniffian.&nbsp; At Cambridge we were not taught pretty manners,
but we knew enough not to give fellowships to pretentious charlatans
like yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
room swam round Professor Lachsyrma, and the mummy behind the door grinned.&nbsp;
The plaster casts and the statues seemed to wave their mutilated limbs
with the joy of demoniacal possession.&nbsp; Dead things were startled
into life.&nbsp; Sick giddiness permeated his brain.&nbsp; It was some
horrible nightmare.&nbsp; Yet his soul&rsquo;s tempest was entirely
subjective; outwardly his demeanour suffered no change.&nbsp; His tormentor
noted with astonishment and admiration his apparent self-control.&nbsp;
There was merely a slight falter in his speech.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What proofs have you?&nbsp; A blackmailer must have some token&mdash;something
on which to base a ridiculous libel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A few minutes ago I handed you a spurious papyrus, which you
tell me you recognise.&nbsp; In the same lot of rubbish, purporting
to come from the Fayy&ucirc;m, were the alleged poems of Sappho.&nbsp;
You swallowed the bait which has waited for you so long, and, if it
is any consolation to you, I will admit that in the opinion of the profession,
to continue my piscatorial simile, I have landed the largest salmon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am deeply sensible of the compliment, but I must point out
to you, my friend, that <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>your
coming to tell me that a papyrus I happen to have purchased from one
of your shady friends is counterfeit, does not necessarily prove it
to be so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Professor realised that he must act cautiously, and consider
his position quietly.&nbsp; Each word must be charged with suppressed
meaning.&nbsp; His eyes wandered over the room, resting now and again
on the majestic, impassive smile of the mummy.&nbsp; It seemed to restore
his nerve.&nbsp; He found himself unconsciously looking towards it over
Carrel&rsquo;s head each time he spoke.&nbsp; While the blackmailer,
seated once more, gazed up to his face with a defiant, insolent stare,
swinging his chair backwards and forwards, unconcerned at the length
of the interview, apparently careless of its issue.&nbsp; The Professor
brooded on the terrible chagrin, the wounded vanity of discovering himself
the victim of an obviously long-contrived hoax.&nbsp; At his asking
for a proof, Carrel laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sceptical at last,&rsquo; he sneered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have the missing portions of the papyrus here with me.&nbsp; You can
have them for a song.&nbsp; I was afraid to leave the roll too complete,
lest I <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>should
invite detection.&nbsp; It would be a pity to let them go to some other
museum.&nbsp; Berlin is longing for a new acquisition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he produced from his bag damning evidence of the truth of his
story&mdash;deftly confected sheets of papyrus, brown with the months
it had taken to fabricate them, and cracked with forger&rsquo;s inks
and acids&mdash;ghastly replicas of the former purchase.&nbsp; Nervously
the Professor replaced the green cardboard shade over the lamp, as though
the glare affected his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how do you know I have not discovered the forgery already?&rsquo;
he said, craftily.&nbsp; Carrel started.&nbsp; &lsquo;And see what I
am sending to the press this evening,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>Walking to the end of the table, he picked up a sheet of paper where
there was writing, and another object which Carrel could not see in
the gloom, so quickly and adroitly was the action accomplished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I read it to you, or will you read it yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He advanced again towards the lamp, held the paper in the light,
and beckoned to Carrel, who leant over the table to see what was written.&nbsp;
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Then
Professor Lachsyrma plunged a long Greek knife into his back.&nbsp;
A toreador could hardly have done it more skilfully; the bull was pinned
through the heart, and expired instantaneously.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Now he paced the room in deep thought.&nbsp; For the first time he
found himself an actor in modern life, which hitherto for him meant
digging among excavations, or making romantic restoration for jaded
connoisseurs, of some faultless work of art described by Pausanias and
hidden for centuries beneath the rubbish of modern Greece.&nbsp; The
entire absence of horror appalled him.&nbsp; Even the dignity of tragedy
was not there.&nbsp; He was wrestling with hideous melodrama, often
described to him by patrons of Thespian art at transpontine theatres.&nbsp;
The vulgarity&mdash;the anachronism&mdash;made him shudder.&nbsp; Having
till now ignored the issue of the present, he began to be sceptical
about the virtues of antiquity.&nbsp; Antiquity, his only religion,
his god, whose mangled incompleteness endeared it to him, was crumbling
away.&nbsp; He wondered if there were friends with whom he might share
his <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>ugly
secret.&nbsp; There was young Fairleigh, who was always so modern, and
actually read modern books.&nbsp; He might have coped with the blackmailer
alive, but hardly with his corpse.&nbsp; You cannot run round and ask
neighbours for coffins, false beards, and rope in the delightful convention
of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, because you have grazed modern life at
a sharp angle, without exciting suspicion or running the risk of positive
refusal.&nbsp; There was his wife, to whom he confided everything; but
she was a lady from Massachusetts, and her father was European correspondent
to many American papers of the highest repute.&nbsp; How could their
pure ears be soiled with so sordid a confidence?&nbsp; Poor Irene! she
was to have an &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; the following afternoon.&nbsp;
It would have to be postponed.&nbsp; Professor Lachsyrma fell to thinking
of such trivial matters, contemptible in their unimportance, as we do
at the terrible moments of our lives.&nbsp; He wondered if they would
wait dinner for him.&nbsp; He often remained at his club&mdash;the Serapeum&mdash;to
finish a discussion with some erudite antagonist.&nbsp; His absence
would therefore cause no alarm.&nbsp; He consulted the little <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>American
clock; it had stopped.&nbsp; How like America!&nbsp; The only recorded
instance, he would explain to Irene, of an export from that country
being required&mdash;the commodity proved inadequate.&nbsp; No, that
would make Irene cry. . . . The folly of hopeless, futile thoughts jingled
on.&nbsp; Suddenly he heard the cry of a belated newsvendor, howling
some British victory, some horrible scandal in Paris.&nbsp; Scandal,
exposure, publicity&mdash;<i>there</i> was the horror.&nbsp; He could
almost hear the journalists stropping their pens.&nbsp; If his thoughts
drifted towards any potential expiation demanded by officialism, he
put them aside.&nbsp; A social <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> was more
fearful and vivid than the dock and its inevitable consequence. . .
. Presently his eyes rested again on the mummy case.&nbsp; A brilliant
inspiration!&nbsp; Here, at all events, was a temporary hiding-place
for the corpse of the blackmailer.&nbsp; If it was putting new wine
into old bottles, circumstances surely justified a violation of the
proverb.&nbsp; Till now a severe unromantic Hellenist, he held Egyptology
in some contempt; and for Egypt, except in so far as it illustrated
the art of Greece or remained a treasure-house for Greek manuscripts,
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>his
distaste was only surpassed by that of the Prophet Isaiah.&nbsp; A bias
so striking in the immortal Herodotus is hardly shared by your modern
encyclop&aelig;dist.&nbsp; While the science of Egyptology and its adepts
command rather awe and wonder than sympathy from the uninitiated, who
keep their praises for the more attractive study of Greek art.&nbsp;
Yet some of us still turn with relief from the serene material masterpieces
of Greece, soulless in their very realism and truth of expression, to
the vague and happily unexplained monsters, the rigid gods and hieratic
princes, who are given new names by each succeeding generation.&nbsp;
A knowledge that behind painted masks and gilded, tawdry gew-gaws are
the remains of a once living person gives even the mummy a human interest
denied to the most exquisite handiwork of Pheidias.</p>
<p>Professor Lachsyrma at present felt only the impossibility of a situation
that would have been difficult for many a weaker man to face.&nbsp;
Humiliation overwhelms the strongest.&nbsp; Modern agencies for the
concealment of a body having failed to suggest themselves, he must needs
fall back on the despised expedient <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>of
Egypt.&nbsp; Pal&aelig;ography and Greek art were obviously useless
in the present instance.&nbsp; He understood at last why deplorable
people wanted to abolish Greek from the University curriculum.</p>
<p>The coffin was of varnished sycamore wood, ornamented on the outside
with gods in their shrines and inscriptions relating to the name and
titles of the deceased, painted in red and green.&nbsp; The face was
carved out of a separate piece of wood, with the conventional beard
attached to the chin; the eyelids were of bronze; the eyes of obsidian;
wooden hands were crossed on the breast.&nbsp; Inside the lid were pictures
of apes in yellow on a purple background, symbolising the Spirits of
the East adoring the Gods of the Morning and Evening.&nbsp; The mummy
itself was enclosed in a handsome cartonnage case laced up the back.&nbsp;
The Professor lifted it gently out on the table, and substituted Carrel&rsquo;s
body.&nbsp; He staunched as he best could the blood which trickled on
to the glaring pictures of the Judgment of Osiris and the goddess Nut
imparting the Waters of Life; then he turned to examine the former occupant,
whom two thousand years, even at such <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>a
moment endowed with a greater interest than could attach to the corpse
of a defunct blackmailer.&nbsp; It now occurred to him that he might
profitably utilise the mummy cerements along with the coffin for more
effectually concealing Carrel&rsquo;s body until he could arrange for
its final disposal.&nbsp; He hastened to carry his idea into effect.</p>
<p>The cartonnage case, composed of waste papyrus fragments glued together,
was painted with figures of deities.&nbsp; The face was a gilded mask,
on the headdress were lotus flowers, and the collar was studded to imitate
precious stones.&nbsp; Over the breast were representations of Horus,
Apis, and Thoth, and lower down the dead man was seen on his bier attended
by Anubis and the children of Horus, while the soul in the form of a
hawk hovered above.&nbsp; The Professor observed that an earlier method
had been employed for the preservation and protection of the body than
is usually found among Ptolemaic mummies.</p>
<p>Beneath a network of blue porcelain bugles and a row of sepulchral
gods suspended by a wire to the neck was a dusky, red-hued sheet, sewn
at the head and feet and fastened with <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>brown
strips of linen.&nbsp; Under this last shroud were the bandages which
swathed the actual corpse, inscribed with passages from the Book of
the Dead, the mysterious fantastic directions for the life hereafter.&nbsp;
The symbolism requisite for the external decoration of the mummy had
been scrupulously executed by skilful artists, and the conscientious
method of wrapping again indicated the pristine mode of embalmment practised
when the craft was at its zenith, long before the Greek conquest of
Egypt.</p>
<p>A considerable time was occupied in unrolling the three or four hundred
yards of linen.&nbsp; Meanwhile a strange fragrance of myrrh, cassia,
cinnamon, the sweet spices and aromatic unguents used in embalming,
filled the room.&nbsp; Gradually the yellow skin preserved by the natron
began to appear through the cross-hatchings of the bandages.&nbsp; Attached
to a thick gold wire round the neck and placed over the heart was a
scarab of green basalt, mounted in a gold setting; and on the henna-stained
little finger of the left hand was another of steatite.&nbsp; As the
right arm was freed from its artificially tightened grasp a peculiar
wooden cylinder rolled on to the floor <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>into
the heap of scented mummy dust and bandages.</p>
<p>Languidly inquisitive, Professor Lachsyrma groped for it.&nbsp; Such
objects are generally found beneath the head.&nbsp; There was a seal
at each end, both of which he broke.&nbsp; A roll of papyrus was inside.&nbsp;
He trembled, and with forced deliberation made for the table, his knees
tottering from exhaustion.&nbsp; Excitement at this unexpected discovery
made him forget Carrel.&nbsp; The ghastly events of the evening were
for the moment blotted from his memory.&nbsp; After all, he was a pal&aelig;ographer&mdash;an
arch&aelig;ologist first, a murderer afterwards.&nbsp; Eagerly, painfully,
he began to read, adjusting his spectacles from time to time, the muscles
of his face twitching with anxiety and expectation.&nbsp; For a long
time the words were strange to him.&nbsp; Suddenly his glasses became
dim.&nbsp; There were tears in his eyes; he was reading aloud, unconsciously
to himself, the beautiful verses familiar to all students of Greek poetry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&Omicron;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &tau;&omicron; &gamma;&lambda;&upsilon;&kappa;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;

</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>and
to students of English, in the marvellous, rendering of them by the
late Mr. Rossetti:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Like the sweet apple which reddens upon the topmost
bough,<br />
A-top on the topmost twig,&mdash;which the pluckers forgot, somehow,&mdash;<br />
Forgot it not, nay, but got it not, for none could get it till now.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The papyrus was of great length, and contained the poems of Sappho
in a cursive literary handwriting of the third century&mdash;the real
poems, lost to the world for over eight hundred years.&nbsp; It was
morning now&mdash;a London spring morning; dawn was creeping through
the great north-east light of the studio; birds were twittering outside.&nbsp;
The murderer sobbed hysterically.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>On referring to &lsquo;Euterpe,&rsquo; the second book of the Histories
of Herodotus, Professor Lachsyrma selected the second method of embalming
as less troublesome and more expeditious.&nbsp; The whole matter lasted
little longer than the seventy prescribed days.&nbsp; At the end of
which time he was able, in accordance with his original intention, to
deposit <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>in
a handsome glass case at the British Museum the Mummy of Heliodorus,
a Greek settler in Egypt who held some official appointment at the Court
of Ptolemy Philadelphus.&nbsp; It is described in the catalogue as one
of the best examples of its kind in Europe.&nbsp; Indeed, it is probably
unique.</p>
<p>Professor Lachsyrma often pauses before the case when visiting our
gaunt House of Art.&nbsp; Even the policeman on duty has noticed this
peculiarity, and smiles respectfully.&nbsp; The Professor has ceased
to ridicule Egyptology; and his confidence in the resources and sufficiency
of antiquity, so rudely shaken for one long evening, is completely re-established.</p>

<p>I once had the good fortune to take down to dinner a young American
lady of some personal attractions.&nbsp; Her vivacity and shrewdness
were racial; her charm peculiar to herself.&nbsp; Her conversation consisted
in a rather fierce denunciation of Englishmen, young Oxford Englishmen
in particular.&nbsp; Their thoughts, their dress, their speech, their
airs of superiority offended one brought up with that Batavian type
of humanity, the American youth, to whom we have nothing exactly corresponding
in this country except among drawing-room conjurors.&nbsp; But I was
startled at her keen observation when I inquired with a smile <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>how
she knew I was not an Oxford man myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you been one, you would never have listened to what I
have been saying,&rsquo; she retorted.&nbsp; Rather nettled, I challenged
her to pick out from the other guests those on whom she detected the
brand of Isis.&nbsp; A pair of gloves was the prize for each successful
guess.&nbsp; She won seven; in fact all the stakes during the course
of the evening.&nbsp; Over one only she hesitated, and when he mentioned
that he had neither the curiosity nor the energy to cross the Atlantic,
she knew he came from Oxford.</p>
<p>Yes, there is something in that manner after all.&nbsp; It irritates
others besides Americans.&nbsp; Novelists try to describe it.&nbsp;
We all know the hero who talks English with a Balliol accent&mdash;that
great creature who is sometimes bow and sometimes cox of his boat on
alternate evenings; who puts the weight at the University Sports and
conducts the lady home from a College wine without a stain on her character;
is rusticated for a year or so; returns to win the Newdigate and leaves
without taking a degree.&nbsp; Or that other delightful abstraction&mdash;he
has a Balliol <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>accent
too&mdash;with literary tastes and artistic rooms, where gambling takes
place.&nbsp; He is invariably a coward, but dreadfully fascinating all
the same; though he scorns women he has an hypnotic influence over them;
something in his polished Oxford manner is irresistible.&nbsp; Throughout
a career of crime his wonderful execution on the piano, his knowledge
of Italian painting, and his Oxford manner never seem to desert him.&nbsp;
We feel, not for the first time, how dangerous it must be to allow our
simple perky unspoiled Colonials to associate with such deleterious
exotic beings, who, though in fiction horsewhipped or (if heroes) shot
in the last chapter, in real life are so apt to become prosperous city
men or respected college officials.</p>
<p>The Oxford manner is, alas, indefinable; I was going to say indefensible.&nbsp;
Perhaps it is an attitude&mdash;a mental attitude that finds physical
expression in the voice, the gesture, the behaviour.&nbsp; Oxford, not
conduct, is three-fourths of life to those who acquire the distemper.&nbsp;
Without becoming personal it is not easy to discuss purely social aspects,
and we must seek chiefly in literature for <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>manifestations
of the phenomenon: in the prose of Matthew Arnold for instance&mdash;in
the poems of Mr. Laurence Binyon, typical examples where every thought
seems a mental reservation.&nbsp; Enemies rail at the voice, and the
voice counts for something.&nbsp; Any one having the privilege of hearing
Mr. Andrew Lang speak in public will know at once what I mean&mdash;a
pleasure, let me hasten to say, only equalled by the enjoyment of his
inimitable writing, so pre-eminently Oxonian when the subject is not
St. Andrews, Folk Lore, or cricket.&nbsp; Though Oxford men have their
Cambridge moments, and beneath their haughty exterior there sometimes
beats a Cambridge heart.&nbsp; Behind such reserve you would never suspect
any passions at all save one of pride.&nbsp; Even frankly irreligious
Oxford men acquire an ecclesiastical pre-Reformation aloofness which
must have piqued Thackeray quite as much as the refusal of the city
to send him to Westminster.&nbsp; He complains somewhere that the undergraduates
wear kid gloves and drink less wine than their jolly brethren of the
Cam.&nbsp; He was thoroughly Cambridge in his attitude towards life,
as you <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>may
see when he writes of his favourite eighteenth century in his own fascinating
style.&nbsp; How angry he becomes with the vices and corruption of a
dead past!&nbsp; Now no Oxford essayist would dream of being angry with
the past.&nbsp; How annoyed the sentimental author of <i>The Four Georges</i>
would be with Mr. Street&rsquo;s genial treatment of the same epoch!&nbsp;
It would, however, be the annoyance of a father for his eldest son,
whom he sent to Oxford perhaps to show that an old slight was forgiven
and forgotten.</p>
<p>There have been, of course, plenty of men unravaged by the blithe
contagion.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone intellectually always seemed to me a
Cambridge man in his energy, his enthusiasm, his political outlook.&nbsp;
Only in his High Church proclivities is he suspect.&nbsp; The poet Shelley
was an obvious Cantab.&nbsp; He was, we are told, a man of high moral
character.&nbsp; Well, principles and human weakness are common to all
Universities, and others besides Shelley have deserted their wives:
but to desert your wife on principle seems to me callous, calculating,
and Cambridge-like.</p>
<p>A painful but interesting case came under <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>my
personal observation, and it illustrates the other side of the question.&nbsp;
A clever young graduate of my acquaintance, after four years of distinguished
scholarship at Oxford, came up to the metropolis and entered the dangerous
lists of literature.&nbsp; It is not indiscreet if I say that he belonged
to what was quite a brilliant little period&mdash;the days of Mr. Eric
Parker, Mr. Max Beerbohm, and Mr. Reginald Turner.&nbsp; So there was
nothing surprising in his literary tastes, though I believe he was unknown
to those masters of prose.&nbsp; He was tall, good-looking, and prepossessing,
but his Oxford manner was unusually pronounced.&nbsp; He never expressed
disgust&mdash;no Oxford man does&mdash;only pained surprise at what
displeased him; he never censured the morals or manners of people as
a Cambridge man might have done.&nbsp; Out of the University pulpit
no Oxford man would dream of scolding people for their morals.&nbsp;
After a year of failure he fell into a decline.&nbsp; His parents became
alarmed.&nbsp; They hinted that his ill success was due to his damned
condescension (the father was of course a Cambridge man).&nbsp; I too
suggested in a mild <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>way
that a more ingratiating manner might produce better luck with editors.&nbsp;
At last his health broke down, and a wise family physician was called
in.&nbsp; After studying the case for some months, Aesculapius (he was
M.B. of Cambridge) divined that ill success rather than ill health was
the provocative; and he related to the patient (this is becoming like
an Arabian Night) the following story:</p>
<p>&lsquo;A certain self-made man, confiding to a friend plans for his
son&rsquo;s education, remarked: &ldquo;Of course I shall send him to
Eton.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why Eton?&rdquo; said the friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because
he is to be a barrister, and if he did not go to Eton no one would speak
to him if they knew his poor old father was a self-made man.&nbsp; Then
he will go to Cambridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not Oxford?&rdquo;
said the friend, who was a self-made Oxford tradesman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because
then he would never speak to me,&rdquo; replied the first self-made
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My friend from that moment recovered.&nbsp; He became more tolerant;
he became successful.&nbsp; He became a distinguished dramatist.&nbsp;
He justified his early promise.</p>
<p>There is in this little story perhaps a charge <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>of
snobbishness from which Oxford men are really entirely free.&nbsp; They
are too conscious of their own superiority to be tuft-hunters, and I
believe miss some of the prizes of life by their indifference towards
those who have already &lsquo;arrived.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet they appear
snobbish to others who have not had the benefit of a University education,
and in this little essay I endeavour to hold up the mirror to their
ill-nature&mdash;the fault to which I am unduly attached.&nbsp; Writers
besides Richardson have referred to it.&nbsp; I might quote many eloquent
tributes from Dryden to Wordsworth and Byron, all Cambridge men, who
have felt the charm and acknowledged a weakness for the step-sister
University.&nbsp; Cambridge has never been fortunate in having the compliment
reciprocated.&nbsp; Neither Oxford men nor her own sons have been over-generous
in her praises: you remember Ruskin on King&rsquo;s Chapel.&nbsp; And
I, the obscurest of her children, who cast this laurel on the Isis,
will content myself with admitting that I sincerely believe you can
obtain a cheaper and better education at Cambridge, though it has always
been my ambition to be mistaken for an Oxford man.</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>I
often wonder whether Mr. Cecil Rhodes, while he had the English Government
in one pocket, the English Press in the other, and South Africa in the
hollow of his hand, felt a certain impotency before Oxford.&nbsp; He
had to acknowledge its influence over himself&mdash;an influence stronger
than Dr. Jameson or the Afrikander Bond.&nbsp; He was never quite sure
whether he admired more the loneliness of the Matoppos or the rather
over-crowded diamond mines of Kimberley.&nbsp; On the grey veld he used
to read <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, and sought in Mr. Pater the key
to the mystery he was unable to solve.&nbsp; He turned to the Thirty-nine
Articles (more tampered with at Oxford than in any other cathedral city)
with the same want of success.&nbsp; That always seems to me a real
touch of Oxford in what some one well said, was an &lsquo;ugly life.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What a wonderful subject for the brush of a Royal Academician! no ordinary
artist could ever do it justice: the great South African statesman on
the lonely rocks where he had chosen his tomb; a book has fallen from
his hand (Mr. Pater&rsquo;s no doubt); his eyes are gazing from canvas
into the future he has peopled with his <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>dreams.&nbsp;
By some clever device of art or nature the clouds in the sky have shaped
themselves into Magdalen Tower&mdash;into harmony with his thoughts,
and the setting sun makes a mandorla behind him.&nbsp; He is thinking
of Oxford, and round his head <i>Oriel</i> clings as in &lsquo;The Blessed
Damozel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could terrorise the Colonial Secretary, he could foment a war
and add a new empire to England; he could not overcome his love of Oxford,
the antithesis of all sordid financial intrigue and political marauding.&nbsp;
Athens was after all a dearer name than Groot-Schuurr.&nbsp; He set
fire to both.</p>
<p>I speculate sometimes whether the University was aware of his testamentary
dispositions before it conferred on him an honorary degree.&nbsp; I
hope not.&nbsp; He deserved it as the greatest son of Oxford, the greatest
Englishman of his time.&nbsp; Imre Kiralfy, who has done for a whole
district of London what Mr. Rhodes tried to do for the empire, is but
an <i>impresario</i> beside him.&nbsp; A French critic says we cannot
admire greatness in England; and this was shown by the timid way a large
number of Imperialists, while professing to <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>believe
the war a righteous one, thought they would seem independent if they
disclaimed approval of Mr. Rhodes, by not having the pluck to admit
the same motives though ready enough to share the plunder.&nbsp; You
may compare the ungrateful half-unfriendly obituaries in the press with
the leaders a few days later, after the will was opened.</p>
<p>But what immediately concerns us here is the intention of Mr. Rhodes.&nbsp;
Was it entirely benevolence, or some wish to test the strength of Oxford&mdash;to
bring undergraduates into contact with something coarser, some terrific
impermeable force that would be manner-proof against Oxford?&nbsp; Would
he conquer from the grave?&nbsp; Several Americans have been known to
go through the University retaining the Massachusetts <i>patina</i>.&nbsp;
What if a number of these savages were grafted on Oxford?&nbsp; How
would they alter the tone?&nbsp; We shall see.&nbsp; It will be an interesting
struggle.&nbsp; Shall we hear of six-shooters in the High?&mdash;of
hominy and flannel cake for breakfast?&mdash;will undergrads look &lsquo;spry?&rsquo;&mdash;will
they &lsquo;voice&rsquo; public opinion? . . . I forbear: my American
vocabulary is limited.&nbsp; <i>Outre</i> <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span><i>mer,
outr&eacute;s m&oelig;urs</i>, as Mr. Walkley might say in some guarded
allusion to Paul Bourget. . . . I shall be sorry to see poker take the
place of roulette, and the Christ Church meadows turned into a ranch
for priggish cowboys, or Addison&rsquo;s Walk re-named the Cake Walk.&nbsp;
But no, I believe Mr. Rhodes, if there was just a touch of malice in
his testament, realised that Oxford manners were stronger than the American
want of them.&nbsp; Oxford may be wounded, but I have complete confidence
in the issue.&nbsp; These B&oelig;otian invaders must succumb, as nobler
stock before them.&nbsp; They will form an interesting subject for some
exquisite study by Mr. Henry James, who will deal with their gradual
civilisation.&nbsp; Preserved in the amber of his art they will become
immortal.</p>
<p>I have been able to clip only the fringe of a great theme.&nbsp;
Athletes require an essay to themselves.&nbsp; In later age they seem
to me more melancholy than their Cambridge peers and less successful.&nbsp;
These splendid creatures are really works of art, and form our only
substitute for sculpture in the absence of any native plastic talent.&nbsp;
From the collector&rsquo;s <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>point
of view they belong to the best period, while the graceful convention
of isocephaly, which has raised the standard of height, renders them
inapt for the &lsquo;battles&rsquo; of life, however well equipped for
those of their College where the cuisine is at all tolerable.</p>
<p>I am not enough of an antiquary to conjecture if there was ever a
temple to Isis during the Roman occupation of Britain on the site of
the now illustrious University.&nbsp; But I like to imagine that there
existed a cultus of the venerable goddess in the green fields where
the purple fritillaries, so reminiscent of the lotus, blossom in the
early spring.&nbsp; In the curious formal pattern of their petals I
see a symbol of the Oxford manner&mdash;something archaic, rigid, severe.&nbsp;
The Oxford Don may well be a reversion to some earlier type, learned,
mystic, and romantic as those priests of whom Herodotus has given us
so vivid a picture.&nbsp; The worship of Apis, as Mr. Frazer or Mr.
Lang would tell us, becomes then merely the hieroglyph for a social
standard, a manner of life.&nbsp; This, I think, will explain the name
Oxford on the Isis&mdash;the Ford of Apis, the ox-god at this one place
able to <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>pass
over the benign deity.&nbsp; You remember, too, the horrid blasphemy
of Cambyses (his very name suggests Cambridge), and the vengeance of
the gods.&nbsp; So be it to any sacrilegious reformer who would transmute
either the Oxford Don or the Oxford undergraduate&mdash;the most august
of human counsellors, the most delightful of friends.</p>

<h2><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>HOW
WE LOST THE BOOK OF JASHER.</h2>
<p>Everyone who knows anything about art, arch&aelig;ology, or science
has heard of the famous FitzTaylor Museum at Oxbridge.&nbsp; And even
outsiders who care for none of these things have heard of the quarrels
and internal dissensions that have disturbed that usual calm which ought
to reign within the walls of a museum.&nbsp; The illustrious founder,
to whose munificence we owe this justly famous institution, provided
in his will for the support of four curators, who govern the two separate
departments of science and art.&nbsp; The University has been in the
habit of making grants of money from time to time to these separate
departments for the acquisition of scientific or arch&aelig;ological
curiosities and MSS.&nbsp; I suppose there was something wrong in the
system, but whatever it may be, it led to notorious jealousies and disputes.&nbsp;
At the time of which I write, the principal curators of the art <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>section
were Professor Girdelstone and Mr. Monteagle, of Prince&rsquo;s College.&nbsp;
I looked after the scientific welfare of the museum with Lowestoft as
my understudy&mdash;he was practically a nonentity and an authority
on lepidoptera.&nbsp; Now, whenever a grant was made to the left wing
of the building, as I call it, I always used to say that science was
being sacrificed to arch&aelig;ology.&nbsp; I mocked at the illuminated
MSS. over which Girdelstone grew enthusiastic, and the musty theological
folios purchased by Monteagle.&nbsp; They heaped abuse upon me, of course,
when my turn came, and cracked many a quip on my splendid skeleton of
the ichthyosaurus, the only known specimen from Greenland.&nbsp; At
one time the strife broke into print, and the London press animadverted
on our conduct.&nbsp; It became a positive scandal.&nbsp; We were advised,
I remember, to wash our dirty linen at home, and though I have often
wondered why the press should act as a voluntary laundress on such occasions,
I suppose the remark is a just one.</p>
<p>There came a day when we took the advice of the press, and from then
until now science <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>and
art have gone hand in hand at the University of Oxbridge.&nbsp; How
the breach was healed forms the subject of the present leaf from my
memoirs.</p>
<p>America, it has been wisely said, is the great land of fraud.&nbsp;
It is the Egypt of the modern world.&nbsp; From America came the spiritualists,
from America bogus goods, and cheap ideas and pirated editions, and
from America I have every reason to believe came Dr. Groschen.&nbsp;
But if his ancestors came from Rhine or Jordan, that he received his
education on the other side of the Atlantic I have no doubt.&nbsp; Why
he came to Oxbridge I cannot say.&nbsp; He appeared quite suddenly,
like a comet.&nbsp; He brought introductions from various parts of the
world&mdash;from the British Embassy at Constantinople, from the British
and German Schools of Arch&aelig;ology at Athens, from certain French
Egyptologists at Alexandria, and a holograph letter from Archbishop
Sarpedon, Patriarch of Hermaphroditopolis, Curator of the MSS. in the
Monastery of St. Basil, at Mount Olympus.&nbsp; It was this last that
endeared him, I believe, to the High Church party in Oxbridge.&nbsp;
Dr. Groschen was already <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the
talk of the University, the lion of the hour, before I met him.&nbsp;
There was rumour of an honorary degree before I saw him in the flesh,
at the high table of my college, a guest of the Provost.&nbsp; If Dr.
Groschen did not inspire me with any confidence, I cannot say that he
excited any feeling of distrust.&nbsp; He was a small, black, commonplace-looking
little man, very neat in his attire, without the alchemical look of
most arch&aelig;ologists.&nbsp; Had I known then, as I know now, that
he presented his first credentials to Professor Girdelstone, I might
have suspected him.&nbsp; Of course, I took it for granted they were
friends.&nbsp; When the University was ringing with praises of the generosity
of Dr. Groschen in transferring his splendid collections of Greek inscriptions
to the FitzTaylor Museum, I rejoiced; the next grant would be devoted
to science, in consideration of the recently enriched galleries of the
art and arch&aelig;ological section.&nbsp; I only pitied the fatuity
of the authorities for being grateful.&nbsp; Dr. Groschen now wound
himself into everybody&rsquo;s good wishes, and the University degree
was already conferred.&nbsp; He was offered <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>a
fine set of rooms in a college famous for culture.&nbsp; He became a
well-known figure on the Q.P.&nbsp; But he was not always with us; he
went to Greece or the East sometimes, for the purpose, it was said,
of adding to the Groschen collection, now the glory of the FitzTaylor.</p>
<p>It was after a rather prolonged period of absence that he wrote to
Girdelstone privately, announcing a great discovery.&nbsp; On his return
he was bringing home, he said, some MSS. recently unearthed by himself
in the monastic library of St. Basil, and bought for an enormous sum
from Sarpedon, the Patriarch of Hermaphroditopolis.&nbsp; He was willing
to sell them to &lsquo;some public institution&rsquo; for very little
over the original price.&nbsp; Girdelstone told several of us in confidence.&nbsp;
It was public news next day.&nbsp; Scholars grew excited.&nbsp; There
were hints at the recovery of a lost MS., which was to &lsquo;add to
our knowledge of the antique world and materially alter accepted views
of the early state of Roman and Greek society.&rsquo;&nbsp; On hearing
the news I smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some institution,&rsquo; that was suspicious&mdash;MSS.&mdash;they
meant forgery.&nbsp; <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>The
new treasure was described as a palimpsest, consisting of fifty or sixty
leaves of papyrus.&nbsp; On one side was a portion of the <i>Lost Book
of Jasher</i>, of a date not later than the fourth century; on the other,
in cursive characters, the too notorious work of Aulus Gellius&mdash;<i>De
moribus Romanorum</i>, concealed under the life of a saint.</p>
<p>But why should I go over old history?&nbsp; Every one remembers the
excitement that the discovery caused&mdash;the leaders in the <i>Times</i>
and the <i>Telegraph</i>, the doubts of the sceptical, the enthusiasm
of the arch&aelig;ologists, the jealousy of the Berlin authorities,
the offers from all the libraries of Europe, the aspersions of the British
Museum.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; asked indignant critics, &lsquo;did
Dr. Groschen offer his MS. to the authorities at Oxbridge?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Because Oxbridge had been the first to recognise his genius,&rsquo;
was the crushing reply.&nbsp; And Professor Girdelstone said that should
the FitzTaylor fail to acquire the MS. by any false economy on the part
of the University authorities, the prestige of the museum would be gone.&nbsp;
But this is all old history.&nbsp; I only remind the reader of what
he knows already.&nbsp; <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>I
began to bring all my powers, and the force of the scientific world
in Oxbridge, to bear in opposition to the purchase of the MS.&nbsp;
I pulled every wire I knew, and execration was heaped on me as a vandal,
though I only said the University money should be devoted to other channels
than the purchase of doubtful MSS.&nbsp; I was doing all this, when
I was startled by the intelligence that Dr. Groschen had suddenly come
to the conclusion that his find was after all only a forgery.</p>
<p>The Book of Jasher was a Byzantine fake, and he ascribed the date
at the very earliest to the reign of Alexis Comnenus.&nbsp; Theologians
became fierce on the subject.&nbsp; They had seen the MS.; they knew
it was genuine.&nbsp; And when Dr. Groschen began to have doubts on
Aulus Gellius, suggesting it was a sixteenth-century fabrication, the
classical world &lsquo;morally and physically rose and denounced&rsquo;
him.&nbsp; Dr. Groschen, who had something of the early Christian in
his character, bore this shower of opprobrium like a martyr.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
may be mistaken,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I believe I have been deceived.&nbsp;
I have been taken in before, and I would not like the MS. <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>offered
to any library before two of the very highest experts could decide as
to its authenticity.&rsquo;&nbsp; People had long learnt to regard Dr.
Groschen himself as quite the highest expert in the world.&nbsp; They
thought he was out of his senses, though the press commended him for
his honesty, and one daily journal, loudest in declaring its authenticity,
said it was glad Dr. Groschen had detected the forgery long recognised
by their special correspondent.&nbsp; Dr. Groschen was furthermore asked
to what experts he would submit his MS., and by whose decision he would
abide.&nbsp; After some delay and correspondence, he could think of
only two&mdash;Professor Girdelstone and Monteagle.&nbsp; They possessed
great opportunities, he said, of judging on such matters.&nbsp; Their
erudition was of a steadier and more solid nature than his own.&nbsp;
Then the world and Oxbridge joined again in a chorus of praise.&nbsp;
What could be more honest, more straightforward, than submitting the
MS. to a final examination at the hands of the two curators of the FitzTaylor,
who were to have the first refusal of the MS. if it was considered authentic?&nbsp;
No <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>museum
was ever given such an opportunity.&nbsp; Professor Girdelstone and
his colleague soon came to a conclusion.&nbsp; They decided that there
could be no doubt as to the authenticity of the Aulus Gellius.&nbsp;
In portions it was true that between the lines other characters were
partly legible; but this threw no slur on the MS. itself.&nbsp; Of the
commentary on the book of Jasher, it will be remembered, they gave no
decisive opinion, and it is still an open question.&nbsp; They expressed
their belief that the Aulus Gellius was alone worth the price asked
by Dr. Groschen.&nbsp; It only remained now for the University to advance
a sum to the FitzTaylor for the purchase of this treasure.&nbsp; The
curators, rather prematurely perhaps, wrote privately to Dr. Groschen
making him an offer for his MS., and paid him half the amount out of
their own pockets, so as to close the bargain once and for all.</p>
<p>The delay of the University in making the grant caused a good deal
of apprehension in the hearts of Professor Girdelstone and Monteagle.&nbsp;
They feared that the enormous sums offered by the Berlin Museum would
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>tempt
even the simple-minded Dr. Groschen, though the interests of the FitzTaylor
were so near his heart.&nbsp; These suspicions proved unfounded as they
were ungenerous.&nbsp; The <i>savant</i> was contented with his degree
and college rooms, and showed no hurry for the remainder of the sum
to be paid.</p>
<p>One night, when I was seated in my rooms beside the fire, preparing
lectures on the ichthyosaurus, I was startled by a knock at my door.&nbsp;
It was a hurried, jerky rap.&nbsp; I shouted, &lsquo;Come in.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The door burst open, and on the threshold I saw Monteagle, with a white
face, on which the beads of perspiration glittered.&nbsp; At first I
thought it was the rain which had drenched his cap and gown, but in
a moment I saw that the perspiration was the result of terror or anxiety
(cf. my lectures on Mental Equilibrium).&nbsp; Monteagle and I in our
undergraduate days had been friends; but like many University friendships,
ours proved evanescent; our paths had lain in different directions.</p>
<p>He had chosen arch&aelig;ology.&nbsp; We failed to convert one another
to each other&rsquo;s views.&nbsp; When he became a member of &lsquo;The
Disciples,&rsquo; <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>a
mystic Oxbridge society, the fissure between us widened to a gulf.&nbsp;
We nodded when we met, but that was all.&nbsp; With Girdelstone I was
not on speaking terms.&nbsp; So when I found Monteagle on my threshold
I confess I was startled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I come in?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, certainly,&rsquo; I said cordially.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
what is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&nbsp; Newall,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;that MS. after
all is a forgery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This expression I thought unbecoming in a &lsquo;Disciple,&rsquo;
but I only smiled and said, &lsquo;Really, you think so?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Monteagle then made reference to our old friendship, our unfortunate
dissensions.&nbsp; He asked for my help, and then really excited my
pity.&nbsp; Some member of the High Church party in Oxbridge had apparently
been to Greece to attend a Conference on the Union of the Greek and
Anglican Churches.&nbsp; While there he met Sarpedon, Patriarch of Hermaphroditopolis,
and in course of conversation told him of the renowned Dr. Groschen.&nbsp;
Sarpedon became distant at mention of the Doctor&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;
He denied all knowledge of the <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>famous
letter of introduction, and said the only thing he knew of the Professor
was, that he was usually supposed to have been the thief who had made
off with a large chest of parchments from the monastery of St. Basil.</p>
<p>The Greek Patriarch refused to give any further information.&nbsp;
The English clergyman reported the incident privately to Girdelstone.</p>
<p>Dr. Groschen&rsquo;s other letters were examined, and found to be
fabrications.&nbsp; The Book of Jasher and Aulus Gellius were submitted
to a like scrutiny.&nbsp; Girdelstone and Monteagle came reluctantly
to the conclusion that they were also vulgar and palpable forgeries.&nbsp;
At the end of his story Monteagle almost burst into tears.&nbsp; I endeavoured
to cheer him, although I was shrieking with laughter at the whole story.</p>
<p>Of course it was dreadful for him.&nbsp; If he exposed Dr. Groschen,
his own reputation as an expert would be gone, and the Doctor was already
paid half the purchase money.&nbsp; Monteagle was so agitated that it
was with difficulty I could get his story out of him, and to this day
I have never quite learned the truth.&nbsp; Controlling my laughter,
I sent a note round to Professor <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Girdelstone,
asking him to come to my rooms.&nbsp; In about ten minutes he appeared,
looking as draggled and sheepish as poor Monteagle.&nbsp; In his bosom
he carried the fateful MS., which I now saw for the first time.&nbsp;
If it was a forgery (and I have never been convinced) it was certainly
a masterpiece.&nbsp; From what Girdelstone said to me, then and since,
I think that the Aulus Gellius portion was genuine enough, and the Book
of Jasher possibly the invention of Groschen; however, it will never
be discovered if one or neither was genuine.&nbsp; Monteagle thought
the ink used was a compound of tea and charcoal, but both he and Girdelstone
were too suspicious to believe even each other by this time.</p>
<p>I tried to console them, and promised all help in my power.&nbsp;
They were rather startled and alarmed when I laid out my plan of campaign.&nbsp;
In the first place, I was to withdraw all opposition to the purchase
of the MS.&nbsp; Girdelstone and Monteagle, meanwhile, were to set about
having the Aulus Gellius printed and facsimiled; for I thought it was
a pity such a work should be lost to the world.&nbsp; The facsimile
was only to be <i>announced</i>; and <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>publication
by the University Press to be put in hand at once.&nbsp; The text of
Aulus Gellius can still be obtained, and a translation of those portions
which can be rendered into English forms a volume of Mr. Bohn&rsquo;s
excellent classical library, which will satisfy the curious, who are
unacquainted with Latin.&nbsp; Professor Girdelstone was to write a
preface in very guarded terms.&nbsp; This will be familiar to all classical
scholars.</p>
<p>It was with great difficulty that I could persuade Girdelstone and
Monteagle of the sincerity of my actions; but the poor fellows were
ready to catch at any straw for hope from exposure, and they listened
to every word I said.&nbsp; As the whole University knew I was not on
speaking terms with Girdelstone, I told him to adopt a Nicodemus-like
attitude, and to come to me in the night-time, when we could hold consultation.&nbsp;
To the outer world, during these anxious evenings, when I would see
no one, I was supposed to be preparing my great syllabus of lectures
on the ichthyosaurus.&nbsp; I communicated to my fellow-curators my
plans bit by bit only, for I thought it would be better for their nerves.&nbsp;
I made Monteagle <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>send
round a notice to the press:&mdash;&lsquo;That the MS. about to become
the property of the University Museum was being facsimiled prior to
publication, and at the earliest possible date would be on view in the
Galleries where Dr. Groschen&rsquo;s collections are now exhibited.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This was to quiet the complaints already being made by scholars and
commentators about the difficulty of obtaining access to the MS.&nbsp;
The importunities of several religious societies to examine the Book
of Jasher became intolerable.&nbsp; The Dean of Rothbury, an old friend
of Girdelstone&rsquo;s, came from the north on purpose to collate the
new-found work.&nbsp; With permission he intended, he said, to write
a small brochure for the S.P.C.K. on the Book of Jasher, though I believe
that he also felt some curiosity in regard to Aulus Gellius.&nbsp; I
may be wronging him.&nbsp; The subterfuges, lies, and devices to which
we resorted were not very creditable to ourselves.&nbsp; Girdelstone
gave him a dinner, and Monteagle and I persuaded the Senate to confer
on him an honorary degree.&nbsp; We amused him with advance sheets of
the commentary.&nbsp; He was quite a month at Oxbridge, but at last
was <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>recalled
on business to the north by some lucky domestic family bereavement.&nbsp;
Our next difficulty was the news that Sarpedon, Patriarch of Hermaphroditopolis,
was about to visit England to attend an Anglican Synod.&nbsp; I thought
Girdelstone would go off his head.&nbsp; Monteagle&rsquo;s hair became
grey in a few weeks.&nbsp; Sarpedon was sure to be invited to Oxbridge.&nbsp;
He would meet Dr. Groschen and then expose him.&nbsp; Our fears, I soon
found out, were shared by the <i>savant</i>, who left suddenly on one
of those mysterious visits to the East.&nbsp; I saw that our action
must be prompt; or Girdelstone and Monteagle would be lost.&nbsp; They
were horrified when I told them I proposed placing the MS. on public
view in the museum immediately.&nbsp; A large plate-glass case was made
by my orders, in which Girdelstone and Monteagle, who obeyed me like
lambs, deposited their precious burden.&nbsp; It was placed in the Groschen
Hall of the FitzTaylor.&nbsp; The crush that afternoon was terrible.&nbsp;
All the University came to peer at the new acquisition.&nbsp; I must
tell you that Dr. Groschen&rsquo;s antiquities occupied a temporary
and fire-proof erection built of wood and tin, <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>at
the back of the museum, with which it was connected by a long stone
gallery, adorned with plaster casts.</p>
<p>I mingled with the crowd, and heard the remarks; though I advised
Girdelstone and Monteagle to keep out of the way, as it would only upset
them.&nbsp; Various dons came up and chaffed me about the opposition
I made to the MS. being purchased.&nbsp; A little man of dark, sallow
complexion asked me if I was Professor Girdelstone.&nbsp; He wanted
to obtain leave to examine the MS.&nbsp; I gave him my card, and asked
him to call on me, when I would arrange a suitable day.&nbsp; He told
me he was a Lutheran pastor from Pomerania.</p>
<p>I was the last to leave the museum that afternoon.&nbsp; I often
remained in the library long after five, the usual closing hour.&nbsp;
So I dismissed the attendants who locked up everything with the exception
of a small door in the stone gallery always used on such occasions.&nbsp;
I waited till six, and as I went out opened near this door a sash window,
having removed the iron shutters.&nbsp; After dinner I went round to
Monteagle&rsquo;s rooms.&nbsp; He and <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Girdelstone
were sitting in a despondent way on each side of the fire, sipping weak
coffee and nibbling Albert biscuits.&nbsp; They were startled at my
entrance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>have</i> you decided?&rsquo; asked Girdelstone, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All is arranged.&nbsp; Monteagle and I set fire to the museum
to-night,&rsquo; I said, quietly.</p>
<p>Girdelstone buried his face in his hands and began to sob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything but that&mdash;anything but that!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
And Monteagle turned a little pale.&nbsp; At first they protested, but
I overcame their scruples by saying they might get out of the mess how
they liked.&nbsp; I advised Girdelstone to go to bed and plead illness
for the next few days, for he really wanted rest.&nbsp; At eleven o&rsquo;clock
that night, Monteagle and myself crossed the meadows at the back of
our college, and by a circuitous route reached the grounds surrounding
the museum, which were planted with rhododendrons and other shrubs.&nbsp;
The pouring rain was, unfortunately, not favourable for our enterprise.&nbsp;
I brought however a small box of combustibles from the University Laboratories,
and a dark lantern.&nbsp; <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>When
we climbed over the low wall not far from the stone gallery, I saw,
to my horror, a light emerging from the Groschen Hall.&nbsp; Monteagle,
who is fearfully superstitious, began chattering his teeth.&nbsp; When
we reached the small door I saw it was open.&nbsp; A thief had evidently
forestalled us.&nbsp; Monteagle suggested going back, and leaving the
thief to make off with the MS.; but I would not hear of such a proposal.</p>
<p>The door opening to the Groschen Hall at the end of the gallery was
open, and beyond, a man, whom I at once recognised as the little Lutheran,
was busily engaged in picking the lock of the case where were deposited
the Book of Jasher and Aulus Gellius.&nbsp; Telling Monteagle to guard
the door, I approached very softly, keeping behind the plaster casts.&nbsp;
I was within a yard of him before he heard my boots creak.&nbsp; Then
he turned round, and I found myself face to face with Dr. Groschen.&nbsp;
I have never seen such a look of terror on any one&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You scoundrel!&rsquo; I cried, collecting myself, &lsquo;drop
those things at once!&rsquo; and I made for him with my fist.&nbsp;
He dodged me.&nbsp; I ran <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>after
him; but he threaded his way like a rat through the statues and cases
of antiquities, and bolted down the passage out of the door, where he
upset Monteagle and the lantern, and disappeared in the darkness and
rain.&nbsp; I then returned to the scene of his labours.&nbsp; Monteagle
was too frightened, owing to the rather ghostly appearance of the museum
by the light of a feeble oil-lamp.&nbsp; In a small cupboard there was
some dry sacking I had deposited there for the purpose some days before.&nbsp;
This I ignited, along with certain native curiosities of straw and skin,
wicker-work, and other ethnographical treasures.</p>
<p>Some new unpacked cases left by the attendants the previous afternoon
materially assisted the conflagration.</p>
<p>It was an impressive scene, to witness the flames playing round the
pedestals of the torsos, statues, and cases.&nbsp; I only waited for
a few moments to make sure that my work was complete.&nbsp; I shut the
iron door between the gallery and the hall to avoid the possibility
of the fire spreading to the rest of the building.&nbsp; Then I seized
Monteagle by the arm and hurried him through the rhododendrons, <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>over
the wall, into the meadows.&nbsp; I turned back once, and just caught
a glimpse of red flame bursting through the windows.&nbsp; Having seen
Monteagle half-way back to the college, I returned to see if any alarm
was given.&nbsp; Already a small crowd was collecting.&nbsp; A fire-engine
arrived, and a local pump was almost set going.&nbsp; I returned to
college, where I found the porter standing in the gateway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The FitzTaylor is burning,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have been looking out for you, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>There is nothing more to tell.&nbsp; To this day no one suspects
that the fire was the work of an incendiary.&nbsp; The Professor has
returned from the East, but lives in great retirement.&nbsp; His friends
say he has never quite recovered the shock occasioned by the loss of
his collection.&nbsp; The rest of the museum was uninjured.</p>
<p>The death of Sarpedon, Patriarch of Hermaphroditopolis, at Naples,
was a sudden and melancholy catastrophe, which people think affected
Dr. Groschen more than the fire.&nbsp; Strangely enough, he had just
been dining <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>with
the Doctor the evening before.&nbsp; They met at Naples purposely to
bury the hatchet.&nbsp; Sometimes I ask myself if I did right in setting
fire to the museum.&nbsp; You see, it was for the sake of others, not
myself, and Monteagle was an old friend.</p>
<h2><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>THE
HOOTAWA VANDYCK.</h2>
<p>&lsquo;My own experience,&rsquo; said an expert to a group of mostly
middle-aged men, who spent their whole life in investigating spiritual
phenomena, &lsquo;is a peculiar one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was in the early autumn of 1900.&nbsp; I was at Rome, where
I went to investigate the relative artistic affinity between Pietro
Cavallini and Giotto (whose position, I think, will have to be adjusted).&nbsp;
There were as yet only a few visitors at the H&ocirc;tel Russie, chiefly
maiden ladies and casual tourists, besides a certain Scotch family and
myself.&nbsp; Colonel Brodie, formerly of the 69th Highlanders, was
a retired officer of that rather peppery type which always seems to
belong to the stage rather than real life, though you meet so many examples
on the Continent.&nbsp; He possessed an extraordinary topographical
knowledge of modern Rome, the tramway system, and the hours at which
churches and galleries were open.&nbsp; He would <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>waylay
you in the entrance-hall and inquire severely if you had been to the
Catacombs.&nbsp; In the case of an affirmative answer he would describe
an unvisited tomb or ruin, far better worth seeing; in that of a negative,
he would smile, tell you the shortest and cheapest route, and the amount
which should be tendered to the Trappist Father.&nbsp; Later on in the
evening, over coffee, if he was pleased with you, he would mention in
a very impressive manner, &ldquo;I am, as you probably know, Colonel
Brodie, of Hootawa.&rdquo;&nbsp; His wife, beside whom I sat at table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te, retained traces of former beauty.&nbsp; She was
thin, and still tight-laced; was somewhat acid in manner; censorious
concerning the other visitors; singularly devoted to her tedious husband,
and fretfully attached to the beautiful daughter, for whose pleasure
and education they were visiting Rome.&nbsp; I gathered that they were
fairly well-to-do.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Brodie who first broke the ice by asking if I was interested
in pictures.&nbsp; Miss Brodie, who sat between her parents, turned
very red, and said, &ldquo;Oh, mamma, you are talking to one of the
greatest experts in <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Europe!&rdquo;&nbsp;
I was surprised and somewhat gratified by her knowledge (indeed, it
chilled me some days later when she confessed to having learnt the information
only that day by overhearing an argument between myself and a friend
at the Colonna Gallery on Stefano de Zevio, and the indebtedness of
Northern Italian art to Teutonic influences).</p>
<p>Mrs. Brodie took the intelligence quite calmly, and merely inspected
me through her lorgnettes as if I were an object in a museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you must talk to Flora about pictures.&nbsp; I have no
doubt that she will tell you a good deal that even <i>you</i> do not
know.&nbsp; We have some very interesting pictures up in Scotland.&nbsp;
My husband is Colonel Brodie of Hootawa (no relation to the Brodie of
Brodie).&nbsp; His grandfather was a great collector, and originally
we possessed seven Raphaels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; I replied, eagerly, &ldquo;might I ask the
names of the pictures?&nbsp; I should know them at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never seen them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brodie; &ldquo;they
were not left to my husband, who quarrelled with his father.&nbsp; Fortunately
<!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>none
of us cared for Raphaels; but the most valuable pictures, including
a Vandyck, were entailed.&nbsp; Flora is particularly attached to Vandyck.&nbsp;
He is always so romantic, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flora, embarrassed by her mother&rsquo;s eulogy of family heirlooms,
leaned across, as if to address me, and said, &ldquo;Oh, mamma, I don&rsquo;t
think they really were Raphaels; they were probably only by pupils&mdash;Giulio
Romano, Perino del Vaga, or Luca Penni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you never saw them, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brodie, severely,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can possibly tell.&nbsp; Your grandfather&rdquo;
(she glared at me) &ldquo;was considered <i>the</i> greatest expert
in Europe, and described them in his will as Raphaels.&nbsp; It would
be impious to suggest that they are by any one else.&nbsp; There were
<i>two</i> Holy Families.&nbsp; One of them was given to your grandfather
by the King of Holland in recognition of his services; and a third was
purchased direct from the Queen of Naples.&nbsp; But your father is
getting impatient for his cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rose, and bowed sweetly.&nbsp; I joined them in the glass winter-garden
a few minutes later.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>&ldquo;Have
you been to the Pincio?&nbsp; But I forgot, of course you know Rome.&nbsp;
I do love the Pincio,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Brodie over some needlework,
and then, as an afterthought, &ldquo;Do you know the two things that
have impressed me most since I came here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not dare to guess any more than I dare tell you what
has impressed me most,&rdquo; I replied, gazing softly at Flora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two things which have really and truly impressed me most,&rdquo;
continued Mrs. Brodie, &ldquo;more than anything else, more than the
Pantheon, or the Forum, are&mdash;St. Peter&rsquo;s and the Colosseum.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She almost looked young again.</p>
<p>The next day we visited the Borghese; and I was able to explain to
Flora why the circular &ldquo;Madonna and Angels&rdquo; was not by Botticelli.&nbsp;
And, indeed, there was hardly a picture in Rome I was unable to reattribute
to its rightful owner.&nbsp; In the apt Flora I found a receptive pupil.&nbsp;
She even grew suspicious about the great Velasquez at the Doria, in
which she fancied, with all the enthusiasm of youth, that she detected
the <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>handling
of Mazo.&nbsp; I soon found that it was better for her training to discourage
her from looking at pictures at all&mdash;we confined ourselves to photographs.&nbsp;
In a photograph you are not disturbed by colour, or by impasto.&nbsp;
You are able to study the morphic values in a picture, by which means
you arrive at the attribution without any disturbing &aelig;sthetic
considerations.</p>
<p>One afternoon, returning from some church ceremony, Flora said to
me, &ldquo;Oh, Aleister&rdquo; (we were already engaged secretly), &ldquo;papa
is going to ask you next winter to stay at Hootawa.&nbsp; Before I forget,
I want to warn you never to criticise the pictures.&nbsp; They are mostly
of the Dutch and English School, and I dare say you will find a great
many of the names wrong; but, you know, papa is irritable, and it would
offend him if you said that the &lsquo;Terborch&rsquo; was really by
Pieter de Hooghe.&nbsp; You can easily avoid saying anything&mdash;and
then, you will really admire the Vandyck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling Flora, of course I promise.&nbsp; By the way, you
never speak of your family ghost, although Mrs. Brodie always refers
to it as if I knew all about it; and the Colonel has <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>often
told me of Sir Rupert&rsquo;s military achievements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aleister, I don&rsquo;t know whether you believe in ghosts:
it <i>is</i> very extraordinary.&nbsp; Whenever any disaster, or any
good fortune happens to our family, Sir Rupert Brodie&rsquo;s figure,
just as he appears in the Vandyck, is seen walking in the Long Gallery;
and every night he appears at twelve o&rsquo;clock in the green spare
bedroom; but only guests and servants ever see him there.&nbsp; We have
a saying at Hootawa, that servants will not stay unless they are able
to see Sir Rupert the first month after their arrival.&nbsp; Only members
of the family are able to see him in the Long Gallery, and, of course,
we never know whether he betokens good or ill luck.&nbsp; The last time
he appeared there, papa was so nervous that he sold out of Consols,
which went down an eighth the day after.&nbsp; We were all very much
relieved.&nbsp; But he invested the money in some concern called &ldquo;The
Imperial Federation Stylograph Pen Company,&rdquo; and lost most of
it; so it was not of much use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, darling, of your father&rsquo;s other investments,&rdquo;
I asked anxiously.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>&ldquo;Oh,
you must ask papa about them, I don&rsquo;t understand business; but
I want to tell you about Sir Rupert.&nbsp; The Society for Psychical
Research sent down a Committee to inquire into the credibility of the
ghost, and recorded four authentic apparitions in the spare bedroom;
and on family evidence accepted at least three events in the Long Gallery.&nbsp;
It was just after their report was issued that papa was invited to lease
the house to some Americans for the summer.&nbsp; He always gets a good
price for it now, simply on account of the ghost.&nbsp; I always think
that rather horrid.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe poor Sir Rupert would
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you don&rsquo;t believe in him,&rdquo; she said
in rather an offended way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, of course I do; I have always believed in ghosts.&nbsp;
Most of the pictures in the world, as I am always saying, were painted
by <i>ghosts</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Aleister, you&rsquo;re laughing at me; but when you
see Sir Rupert, as you will, in the spare bedroom, you will believe
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of January, I became Flora&rsquo;s accepted fianc&eacute;.</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>In
February, I moved with the Brodies to Florence, where I was able to
introduce them to all my kind and hospitable friends,&mdash;the Berensons,
Mr. Charles Loeser, Mr. Herbert Horne, and Mr. Hobart Cust.&nbsp; Flora
was in every way a great success, and commenced a little book on Nera
di Bicci for Bell&rsquo;s Great Painters Series.&nbsp; She was invited
to contribute to the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>.&nbsp; It was quite
a primavera.&nbsp; Our marriage was arranged for the following February.&nbsp;
The Brodies were to return to Hootawa after it was vacated by the American
summer tenants.&nbsp; I was to join them for Christmas on my return
from America, where I was compelled to go in order to settle my affairs.&nbsp;
My father, Lorenzo Q. Sweat, of Chicago, evinced great pleasure at my
approaching union with an old Scotch family; he promised me a handsome
allowance considering his recent losses in the meat packing swindle&mdash;I
mean trade.&nbsp; I was able to dissuade him from coming to Europe for
the ceremony.&nbsp; After delivering two successful lectures on Pietro
Cavallini in the early fall at mothers&rsquo; soir&eacute;es, I sailed
for Liverpool.</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>There
was deep snow on the ground when I arrived at Hootawa in the early afternoon
of a cold December day.&nbsp; The Colonel met me at the station in the
uniform of the 69th, attended by two gillies holding torches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will just be enough light to glance at the pictures
before tea,&rdquo; he said gaily, and in three-quarters of an hour I
was embracing Flora and saluting her mother, who were in the hall to
greet me.&nbsp; For the most part Hootawa was a typical old Scotch castle,
with extinguisher turrets; an incongruous Jacobean addition rather enhancing
its picturesque ensemble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see better pictures here than anything in Rome,&rdquo;
remarked the Colonel; but Flora giggled rather nervously.</p>
<p>In the smoking-room and library, I inspected, with assumed interest,
works by the little masters of Holland, and some more admirable examples
of the English Eighteenth Century School.&nbsp; Faithful to my promise,
I pronounced every one of them to be little gems, unsurpassed by anything
in the private collections of America or Europe.&nbsp; We passed into
the drawing-room and parlour with the same success.&nbsp; In the latter
apartment the <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Colonel,
grasping my arm, said impressively: &ldquo;Now you will see our great
treasure, the Brodie Vandyck, of which Flora has so often told you.&nbsp;
I have never lent it for exhibition, for, as you know, we are rather
superstitious about it.&nbsp; Sir Joshua Reynolds, in 1780, offered
to paint the portraits of the whole family in exchange for the picture.&nbsp;
Dr. Waagen describes it in his well-known work.&nbsp; Dr. Bode came
from Berlin on purpose to see it some years ago, when he left a certificate
(which was scarcely necessary) of its undoubted authenticity.&nbsp;
I was so touched by his genuine admiration, that I presented him with
a small Dutch picture which he admired in the smoking-room, and thought
not unworthy of placing in the Berlin Gallery.&nbsp; I expect you know
Dr. Bode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not personally,&rdquo; I said, as we stepped into the Long
Gallery.</p>
<p>It was a delightful panelled room, with oak-beamed ceiling.&nbsp;
Between the mullioned windows were old Venetian mirrors and seventeenth-century
chairs.&nbsp; At the end, concealed by a rich crimson brocade, hung
the Vandyck, the only picture on the walls.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>It
was the Colonel himself who drew aside the curtain which veiled discreetly
the famous picture of Sir Rupert Brodie at the age of thirty-two, in
the beautiful costume of the period.&nbsp; The face was unusually pallid;
it was just the sort of portrait you would expect to walk out of its
frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never seen a finer Vandyck, I am sure,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Brodie, anxiously.&nbsp; I examined the work with great care, employing
a powerful pocket-glass.&nbsp; There was an awkward pause for about
five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the Colonel, sternly, &ldquo;have you
nothing to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very interesting and excellent work, though <i>not</i>
by Vandyck; it is by Jamieson, his Scotch pupil; the morphic forms .
. .&rdquo;&mdash;but I got no further.&nbsp; There was a loud clap of
thunder, and Flora fainted away.&nbsp; I was hastening to her side when
her father&rsquo;s powerful arm seized my collar.&nbsp; He ran me down
the gallery and out by an egress which led into the entrance hall, where
some menial opened the massive door.&nbsp; I felt one stinging blow
on my face; then, bleeding and helpless, I was kicked down the steps
into the snow <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>from
which I was picked up, half stunned, by one of the gillies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, mon, hae ye seen the bogles at Hootawa?&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be very civil of you if you will conduct me to the
dep&ocirc;t, or the nearest caravanserai,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>I never saw Flora again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what has happened about the ghost, Mr. Sweat?&nbsp; You
never told us anything about it.&nbsp; Did you ever see it?&rsquo; asked
one of the listeners in a disappointed tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I forgot; no, that was rather tragic.&nbsp; <i>Sir Rupert
Brodie never appeared again</i>, not even in the spare bedroom; he seemed
offended.&nbsp; Eventually his portrait was sent up to London, where
Mr. Lionel Cust pointed out that it could not have been painted until
after Vandyck&rsquo;s death, at which time Sir Rupert was only ten years
old.&nbsp; Indeed, there was some uncertainty whether the picture represented
Sir Rupert at all.&nbsp; Mr. Bowyer Nichols found fault with the costume,
which belonged to an earlier date prior to Sir Rupert&rsquo;s <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>birth.&nbsp;
Colonel Brodie never recovered from the shock.&nbsp; He resides chiefly
at Harrogate.&nbsp; Gradually the servants all gave notice, and Hootawa
ceased to attract Americans.&nbsp; Poor Flora!&nbsp; I ought to have
remembered my promise; but the habit was too strong in me.&nbsp; Sir
Oliver Lodge, I believe, has an explanation for the non-appearance of
the phantom after the events I have described.&nbsp; He regards it as
a good instance of <i>bypsychic duality</i>&mdash;the fortuitous phenomenon
by which spirits are often uncertain as to whom they really represent.&nbsp;
But I am only an art critic, not a physicist.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>THE
ELEVENTH MUSE.</h2>
<p>In the closing years of the last century I held the position of a
publisher&rsquo;s hack.&nbsp; Having failed in everything except sculpture,
I became publisher&rsquo;s reader and adviser.&nbsp; It was the age
of the &lsquo;dicky dongs,&rsquo; and, of course, I advised chiefly
the publication of deciduous literature, or books which dealt with the
history of decay.&nbsp; The business, unfortunately, closed before my
plans were materialised; but there was a really brilliant series of
works prepared for an ungrateful public.&nbsp; A cheap and abridged
edition of Gibbon was to have heralded the &lsquo;Ruined Home&rsquo;
Library, as we only dealt with the decline and fall of things, and eschewed
Motley in both senses of the word.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bad Taste in All Ages&rsquo;
(twelve volumes edited by myself) would have rivalled some of Mr. Sidney
Lee&rsquo;s monumental undertakings.&nbsp; It was a memory of these
unfulfilled designs which has turned my thoughts to an old notebook&mdash;the
skeleton of what was destined never to be a book in being.</p>
<p>I have often wondered why no one has ever <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>tried
to form an anthology of bad poetry.&nbsp; It would, of course, be easy
enough to get together a dreary little volume of unreadable and unsaleable
song.&nbsp; There are, however, certain stanzas so exquisite in their
unconscious absurdity that an inverted immortality may be claimed for
them.&nbsp; It is essential that their authors should have been serious,
because parody and light verse have been carried to such a state of
perfection that a tenth muse has been created&mdash;the muse of Mr.
Owen Seaman and the late St. John Hankin for example.&nbsp; When the
Anakim, men of old, which were men of renown&mdash;Shelley, Keats, or
Tennyson&mdash;become playful, I confess to a feeling of nervousness:
the unpleasant, hot sensation you experience when a distinguished man
makes a fool of himself.&nbsp; Rossetti&mdash;I suppose from his Italian
origin&mdash;was able to assume motley without loss of dignity, and
that wounded Titan, the late W. E. Henley, was another exception.&nbsp;
Both he and Rossetti had the faculty of being foolish, or obscene, without
impairing the high seriousness of their superb poetic gifts.</p>
<p>But I refer to more serious folly&mdash;that of <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the
disciples of Silas Wegg.&nbsp; Some friends of mine in the country employed
a ladies&rsquo;-maid with literary proclivities.&nbsp; She was never
known to smile; the other servants thought her stuck up; she was a great
reader of novels, poetry, and popular books on astronomy.&nbsp; One
day she gave notice, departed at the end of a month, left no address,
and never applied for a character.&nbsp; Beneath the mattress of her
bed was found a manuscript of poems.&nbsp; One of these, addressed to
our satellite, is based on the scientific fact (of which I was not aware
until I read her poem) that we see only one side of the moon.&nbsp;
The ode contains this ingenious stanza:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O beautiful moon!<br />
When I gaze on thy face<br />
Careering among the boundaries of space,<br />
The thought has often come to my mind<br />
If I ever shall see thy glorious behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was my pleasure to communicate this verse to our greatest living
conversationalist, a point I mention because it may, in consequence,
be already known to those who, like myself, enjoy the privileges of
his inimitable talk.&nbsp; I possess the original manuscript of the
<!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>poem,
and can supply copies of the remainder to the curious.</p>
<p>In a magazine managed by the physician of a well-known lunatic asylum
I found many inspiring examples.&nbsp; The patients are permitted to
contribute: they discuss art and literature, subject of course to a
stringent editorial discretion.&nbsp; As you might suppose, poetry occupies
a good deal of space.&nbsp; It was from that source of clouded English
I culled the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>His hair is red and blue and white,<br />
His face is almost tan,<br />
His brow is wet with blood and sweat,<br />
He steals from where he can:<br />
And looks the whole world in the face,<br />
A drunkard and a man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we have here a Henley manqu&eacute;.&nbsp; In robustious
assertion you will not find anything to equal it in the Hospital Rhymes
of that author.&nbsp; I was so much struck by the poem that I obtained
permission to correspond with the poet.&nbsp; I discovered that another
Sappho might have adorned our literature; that a mute inglorious Elizabeth
Barrett was kept silent in Darien&mdash;for the asylum was in <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the
immediate vicinity of the Peak in Derbyshire.&nbsp; Of the correspondence
which ensued I venture to quote only one sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I was brought up to love beauty; my home was more
than cultured; it was refined; we took in the <i>Art Journal</i> regularly.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of all modern artists, I suppose that Sir Edward Burne-Jones has
inspired more poetry than any other.&nbsp; A whole school of Oxford
poets emerged from his fascinating palette, and he is the subject of
perhaps the most exquisite of all the <i>Poems and Ballads</i>&mdash;the
&lsquo;<i>Dedication</i>&rsquo;&mdash;which forms the colophon to that
revel of rhymes.&nbsp; I sometimes think that is why his art is out
of fashion with modern painters, who may inspire dealers, but would
never inspire poets.&nbsp; For who could write a sonnet on some uncompromising
pieces of realism by Mr. Rothenstein, Mr. John, or Mr. Orpen?&nbsp;
Theirs is an art which speaks for itself.&nbsp; But Sir Edward Burne-Jones
seems to have dazzled the undergrowth of Parnassus no less than the
higher slopes.&nbsp; In a long and serious epic called &lsquo;The Pageant
of Life,&rsquo; dealing with every conceivable subject, I found:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>With
some the mention of Burne-Jones<br />
Elicits merely howls and groans;<br />
But those who know each inch of art<br />
Believe that he can bear his part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what he could bear.&nbsp; Perhaps it referred
to his election at the Royal Academy.&nbsp; Then, again, in a &lsquo;Vision&rsquo;
of the next world, a poet described how&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Byron, Burne-Jones, and Beethoven,<br />
Charlotte Bronte and Chopin are there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if this has escaped the eagle eye of Mr. Clement Shorter.&nbsp;
Though perhaps the most delightful nonsense, for which, I fear, this
great painter is partly responsible, may be found in a recent poem addressed
to the memory of my old friend, Simeon Solomon:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>More of Rossetti?&nbsp; Yes:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You follow&rsquo;d than Burne-Jones,<br />
Your depth of colour his<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; than that of monochromes!<br />
Yes; amber lilies poured, I say,<br />
A joy for thee, than poet&rsquo;s bay.</p>
<p>But while true art refines<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and often stimulates,<br />
<span class="smcap">Art</span> does, at times, I say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; sit grief within our gates!<br />
Art causes men to weep at times&mdash;<br />
If you may heed these falt&rsquo;ring rhymes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>A
small volume of lyrics once sent to me for review afforded another flower
for my garland:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Where in the spring-time leaves are wet,<br />
Oh, lay my love beneath the shades,<br />
Where men remember to forget,<br />
And are forgot in Hades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I have given enough examples for what would form Part I. of the
English anthology.&nbsp; Part II. would consist of really bad verses
from really great poetry.</p>
<blockquote><p>Auspicious Reverence, hush all meaner song,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is one of the most pompously stupid lines in English poetry.&nbsp;
Arnold did not hesitate to quote instances from Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Till that Bellona&rsquo;s bridegroom, lapp&rsquo;d in
proof,<br />
Confronted him with self-comparisons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would have to sacrifice Browning, because it might fairly be
concluded&mdash;well, anything might be concluded about Browning.&nbsp;
Byron is, of course, a mine.&nbsp; Arthur Hugh Clough is, perhaps, the
&lsquo;flawless numskull,&rsquo; as, I think, Swinburne calls him.&nbsp;
Tennyson surpassed</p>
<blockquote><p>A Mr. Wilkinson, a clergyman,</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>in
many of his serious poems.</p>
<blockquote><p>To travellers indeed the sea<br />
Must always interesting be</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have heard ascribed to Wordsworth, but wrongly, I believe.&nbsp;
I should, of course, exclude from the collection living writers; only
the select dead would be requisitioned.&nbsp; They cannot retort.&nbsp;
And the entertaining volume would illustrate that curious artistic law&mdash;the
survival of the unfittest, of which we are only dimly beginning to realise
the significance.&nbsp; It is like the immortality of the invalid, now
recognised by all men of science.&nbsp; You see it manifested in the
plethora of memoirs.&nbsp; All new books not novels are about great
dead men by unimportant little living ones.&nbsp; When I am asked, as
I have been, to write recollections of certain &lsquo;people of importance,&rsquo;
as Dante says, I feel the force of that law very keenly.</p>

A PROPHETIC BOOK, WITH HOME ZARATHRUSTS.</h2>
<p>Every student of Blake has read, or must read, Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s
extraordinary essay, <i>William Blake: a critical study</i>, of which
a new edition was recently published.&nbsp; It would be idle at this
time of day to criticise.&nbsp; Much has been discovered, and more is
likely to be discovered, about Blake since 1866.&nbsp; The interest
of the book, for us, is chiefly reflex.&nbsp; <i>And does not the great
mouth laugh at a gift</i>, if scheduled in an examination paper with
the irritating question, &lsquo;From what author does this quotation
come?&rsquo; would probably elicit the reply, &lsquo;Swinburne.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Yet it occurs in one of Blake&rsquo;s prophetic books.</p>
<p>How fascinated Blake would have been with Mr. Swinburne if by some
exquisite accident he had lived <i>after</i> him.&nbsp; We should <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>have
had, I fancy, another Prophetic Book; something of this kind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swinburne roars and shakes the world&rsquo;s literature&mdash;<br />
The English Press, and a good many contemporaries&mdash;<br />
Tennyson palls, Browning is found&mdash;<br />
Only a brownie&mdash;<br />
The mountains divide, the Press is unanimous&mdash;<br />
Aylwin is born&mdash;<br />
On a perilous path, on the cliff of immortality&mdash;<br />
I met Theodormon&mdash;<br />
He seemed sad: I said, &lsquo;Why are you sad&mdash;<br />
Are you writing the long-promised life&mdash;<br />
Of Dante Gabriel Rossetti?&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
He sighed and said, &lsquo;No, not that&mdash;<br />
Not that, my child&mdash;<br />
I consigned the task to William Michael&mdash;<br />
Pre-Raphaelite memoirs are cheap to-day&mdash;<br />
You can have them for a sextet or an octave.&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
I brightened and said, &lsquo;Then you are writing a sonnet?&rsquo;<br />
He shook his head and said it was symbolical&mdash;<br />
For six and eightpence!&mdash;<br />
A golden rule: Never lend only George Borrow&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A new century had begun, and I asked Theodormon what he was doing
on that path and where Mr. Swinburne was.&nbsp; Beneath us yawned the
gulf of oblivion.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>&lsquo;Be
careful, young man, not to tumble over; are you a poet or a biographer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I explained that I was merely a tourist.&nbsp; He gave a sigh of
relief: &lsquo;I have an appointment here with my only disciple, Mr.
Howlglass; if you are not careful he may write an appreciation of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Theodormon, if you will show me how to reach Mr. Swinburne
I will help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I swear by the most sacred of all oaths, by Aylwin, you shall
see Swinburne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just then we saw a young man coming along the path with a Kodak and
a pink evening paper.&nbsp; He seemed pleased to see me, and said, &lsquo;May
I appreciate you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I gave the young man a push and he fell right over the cliff.&nbsp;
Theodormon threw down after him a heavy-looking book which, alighting
on his skull, smashed it.&nbsp; &lsquo;My preserver,&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;you shall see what you like, you shall do what you like, except
write my biography.&nbsp; Swinburne is close at hand, though he occasionally
wanders.&nbsp; His permanent address is the Peaks, Parnassus.&nbsp;
Perhaps you would like to pay some other calls as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I assented.</p>
<p><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>We
came to a printing-house and found William Morris reverting to type
and transmitting art to the middle classes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The great Tragedy of Topsy&rsquo;s life,&rsquo; said Theodormon,
&lsquo;is that he converted the middle classes to art and socialism,
but he never touched the unbending Tories of the proletariat or the
smart set.&nbsp; You would have thought, on hom&oelig;opathic principles,
that cretonne would appeal to cretins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vale, vale,&rsquo; cried Charles Ricketts from the interior.</p>
<p>I was rather vexed, as I wanted to ask Ricketts his opinions about
various things and people and to see his wonderful collection.&nbsp;
Shannon, however, presented me with a lithograph and a copy of &lsquo;Memorable
Fancies,&rsquo; by C. R.</p>
<blockquote><p>How sweet I roamed from school to school,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I attached myself to none;<br />
I sat upon my ancient Dial<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And watched the other artists&rsquo; fun.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe for the Academic fold;<br />

</blockquote>
<p>After turning round a rather sharp corner I began to ask Theodormon
if John Addington Symonds was anywhere to be found.&nbsp; He smiled,
and said: &lsquo;I know why you are asking.&nbsp; Of course he <i>is</i>
here, but we don&rsquo;t see much of him.&nbsp; He published, at the
Kelmscott, the other day, &ldquo;An Ode to a Grecian Urning.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The proceeds of the sale went to the Arts and Krafts Ebbing Guild, but
the issue of &ldquo;Aretino&rsquo;s Bosom, and other Poems,&rdquo; has
been postponed.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>We
now reached a graceful Renaissance building covered with blossoms; on
each side of the door were two blue-breeched gondoliers smoking calamus.&nbsp;
Theodormon hurried on, whispering: &lsquo;<i>That</i> is where he lives.&nbsp;
If you want to see Swinburne you had better make haste, as it is getting
late, and I want you to inspect the Castalian spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The walking became very rough just here; it was really climbing.&nbsp;
Suddenly I became aware of dense smoke emerging with a rumbling sound
from an overhanging rock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had no idea Parnassus was volcanic now,&rsquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more had we,&rsquo; said Theodormon; &lsquo;it is quite
a recent eruption due to the Celtic movement.&nbsp; The rock you see,
however, is not a real rock, but a sham rock.&nbsp; Mr. George Moore
has been turned out of the cave, and is still hovering about the entrance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Looming through the smoke, which hung like a veil of white muslin
between us, I was able to trace the silhouette of that engaging countenance
which Edouard Manet and others have immortalised.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go away,&rsquo;
he said: &lsquo;I do not want to speak to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>&lsquo;Come,
come, Mr. Moore,&rsquo; I rejoined, &lsquo;will you not grant a few
words to a really warm admirer?&rsquo;&mdash;but he had faded away.&nbsp;
Then a large hand came out of the cavern and handed me a piece of paper,
and a deep voice with a slight brogue said: &lsquo;If you see mi darlin&rsquo;
Gosse give this to him.&rsquo;&nbsp; The paper contained these verses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Georgey Morgie, kidden and sly,<br />
Kissed the girls and made them cry;<br />
<i>What</i> the girls came out to say<br />
George never heard, for he ran away.</p>
<p>W. B. Y</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We skirted the edge of a thick wood.&nbsp; A finger-post pointed
to the Castalian spring, and a notice-board indicated <i>Trespassers
will be prosecuted</i>.&nbsp; <i>The lease to be disposed of.&nbsp;
Apply to G. K. Chesterton</i>.</p>
<p>Soon we came to an open space in which was situated a large, rather
dilapidated marble tank.&nbsp; I noticed that the water did not reach
further than the bathers&rsquo; stomachs.&nbsp; Theodormon anticipated
my surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, we have had to depress the level of the
water during the last few years out of compliment to some <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>of
the bathers, and there have been a good many bathing fatalities of a
very depressing description.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;Richard
le Gallienne?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush! hush! he was rescued.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen Phillips?&rsquo; I asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he couldn&rsquo;t swim, of course, but he floated; you
see he had the Sidney Colvin lifebelt on, and that is always a great
assistance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not,&rsquo; I almost shrieked, &lsquo;my favourite poet, the
author of &ldquo;Lord &rsquo;a Muzzy don&rsquo;t you fret.&nbsp; Missed
we De Wet.&nbsp; Missed we De Wet&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Theodormon became very grave.&nbsp; &lsquo;We do not know any of
their names,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will show you, presently,
the Morgue.&nbsp; Perhaps you will be able to identify some of your
friends.&nbsp; The Coroner has refused to open an inquest until Mr.
John Lane can attend to give his evidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I saw the Poet Laureate trying very hard to swim on his back.&nbsp;
Another poet was sitting down on the marble floor so that the water
might at least come up to his neck.&nbsp; Gazing <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>disconsolately
into the pellucid shallows I saw the revered and much-loved figures
of Mr. Andrew Lang, Mr. Austin Dobson, and Mr. Edmund Gosse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Going
for a dip?&rsquo; said Theodormon.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thanks, we don&rsquo;t
care about paddling,&rsquo; Mr. Lang retorted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it is not <i>always</i> so shallow,&rsquo; I said to
my guide.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no; we have a new water-supply, but as the spring is in
the nature of a public place, we won&rsquo;t turn on the fresh water
until people have learnt to appreciate what is good.&nbsp; That handsome
little marble structure which you see at the end of the garden is really
the <i>new</i> Castalian Spring.&nbsp; At all events, that is where
all the miracles take place.&nbsp; The old bath is terribly out of repair,
in spite of plumbing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We then inspected a very neat little apartment mosaiced in gold.&nbsp;
Round the walls were attractive drinking-fountains, and on each was
written the name of the new water&mdash;I mean the new poet.&nbsp; Some
of them I recognised: Laurence Binyon, A. E. Housman, Sturge Moore,
Santayana, Arthur Symons, Herbert Trench, Henry Simpson, Laurence <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Housman,
F. W. Tancred, Arthur Lyon Raile, William Watson, Hugh Austin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see we have the very latest,&rsquo; said Theodormon, &lsquo;provided
it is always the best.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that some of the taps
don&rsquo;t give a constant supply, but that is because the machinery
wants oiling.&nbsp; Try some Binyon,&rsquo; said my guide, filling a
gold cup on which was wrought by some cunning craftsman the death of
Adam and the martyrdom of the Blessed Christina.&nbsp; I found it excellent
and refreshing, and observed that it was cheering to come across the
excellence of sincerity and strength at a comparatively new source .
. .</p>
<p>Mr. Swinburne was seated in an arbour of roses, clothed in a gold
dalmatic, a birthday gift from his British Peers.&nbsp; Their names
were embroidered in pearls on the border.&nbsp; I asked permission to
read my address:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There beats no heart by Cam or Isis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Where tides of poets ebb and flow),<br />
But guards Dolores as a crisis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of long ago.</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>A
crisis bringing fire and wonder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A gift of some dim Eastern Mage,<br />
A firework still smouldering under<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The feet of middle age.</p>
<p>For you could love and hate and tell us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of almost everything,<br />
You made our older poets jealous,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For you alone could sing.</p>
<p>In truth it was your splendid praises<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which made us wake<br />
To glories hidden in the phrases<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of William Blake.</p>
<p>No boy who sows his metric salads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His tamer oats,<br />
But always steals from Swinburne&rsquo;s ballads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stronger notes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Do you play golf?&rsquo; said Mr. Swinburne, handing me two
little spheres such as are used in the royal game.&nbsp; And I heard
no more; for I received a blow&mdash;whether delivered by Mr. Swinburne
or the ungrateful Theodormon I do not know, but I found myself falling
down the gulf of oblivion, and suddenly, with a dull thud, I landed
on the remains of Howlglass.&nbsp; The softness of his head had really
preserved me from what might have <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>been
a severe shock, because the distance from Parnassus to Fleet Street,
as you know, is considerable, and the escalade might have been more
serious.&nbsp; I reached my rooms in Half Moon Street, however, having
seen only one star, with just a faint nostalgia for the realms into
which for one brief day I was privileged to peep.</p>
<p>(1906.)</p>
<h2><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>A
MISLAID POET.</h2>
<p>In the closing years of my favourite last century, when poetry was
more discussed than it is now (at all events as a marketable commodity),
few verse-writers were overlooked.&nbsp; Bosola&rsquo;s observation
about &lsquo;the neglected poets of your time&rsquo; could not be quoted
with any propriety.&nbsp; Mr. John Lane would make long and laborious
journeys on the District Railway, armed <i>bag-&agrave;-pied</i>, in
order to discover the new and unpublished.&nbsp; Now he has shot over
all the remaining preserves; laurels and bays, so necessary for the
breed &lsquo;of men and women over-wrought,&rsquo; have withered in
the London soot.&nbsp; There was one bright creature, however, who escaped
his rifle; she was brought down by another sportsman, and thus missed
some of the fame which might have attached to her had she been trussed
and hung in the Bodley Head.&nbsp; Poaching in the library at Thelema,
I came across her by accident.&nbsp; Her song is not without significance.</p>
<p>In 1878 Georgiana Farrer mentioned on <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>page
190 of her <i>Miscellaneous Poems</i>, &lsquo;I am old by sin entangled;&rsquo;
but this was probably a pious exaggeration.&nbsp; Only some one young
and intellectually very vigorous could have penned her startling numbers.&nbsp;
I suggest that she retained more of her youth than, from religious motives,
she thought it proper to admit.&nbsp; In the &rsquo;eighties, when incense
was burned in drawing-rooms, and people were talking about &lsquo;The
Blessed Damozel,&rsquo; she could write of Paradise:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A home where Jesus Christ is King,<br />
A home where e&rsquo;en Archangels sing,<br />
Where common wealth is shared by all,<br />
And God Himself lights up the Hall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was philosemite, and from the reference to Lord Beaconsfield
we can easily date the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>You who doubt the truth of Scripture,<br />
Pray tell me, then, who are the Jews?<br />
Scattered in all lands and nations,<br />
Pray why their evidence refuse?</p>
<p>It seems to me you must be blind;<br />
Are they not daily gaining ground?<br />
We find them now in every land,<br />
And well-nigh ruling all around.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Their
music is most sweet to hear;<br />
Jews were Rossini and Mozart,<br />
Mendelssohn, too, and Meyerbeer;<br />
Grisi in song could charm the heart.</p>
<p>The funds their princes hold in hand;<br />
Their merchants trade both near and far;<br />
Ill-used and robbed they long have been,<br />
Yet wealthy now they surely are.</p>
<p>In Germany who has great sway?<br />
Prince Bismarck, most will answer me;<br />
Our own Prime Minister retains<br />
A name that shows his pedigree.</p>
<p>Who after this will dare to say<br />
They nought in these strange people see;<br />
Do they not prove the Scripture true,<br />
And throw a light on history?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The twenty-five years that have elapsed since the poem was written
must have convinced those innocent persons who &lsquo;saw nought&rsquo;
in our Israelitish compatriots.&nbsp; I never heard before that Prince
Bismarck or Mozart was of Jewish extraction!</p>
<p>Mrs. Farrer was, of course, an evangelical, somewhat old-fashioned
for so late a date; and fairly early in her volume she warns us of what
we may expect.&nbsp; She is anxious to <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>damp
any undue optimism as to the lightness of her muse.&nbsp; When worldly,
foolish people like Whistler and Pater were talking &lsquo;art for art&rsquo;s
sake,&rsquo; she could strike a decisive didactic blow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My voice like thunder may appear,<br />
Yet oft-times I have shed a tear<br />
Behind the peal, like rain in storm,<br />
To moisten those I would reform.</p>
<p>Then pardon if my stormy mood,<br />
Instead of blighting, does some good.<br />
Sooner a thunder-clap, think me,<br />
Than sunstroke sent in wrath on thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a splendid Calvinism, too rare at that time, she would not argue
beyond a <i>certain</i> limit; there was an edge, she realised, to every
platform; an ounce of assertion is worth pounds of proof.&nbsp; Religious
discussion after a time becomes barren:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Then hundredfolds to sinners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must be repaid in Hell.<br />
If you think such men winners,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to the person who <i>is</i> right (and Mrs. Farrer was never
in a moment&rsquo;s doubt, though her prosody is influenced sometimes
by the <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>sceptical
Matthew Arnold) there is no mean reward:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I sparkle resplendent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A star in His crown,<br />
And glitter for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A gem of renown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From internal evidence we can gauge her social position, while her
views of caste appear in these radical days a trifle <i>demod&eacute;</i>.&nbsp;
Her metaphors of sin are all derived from the life of paupers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Paupers through their sinful folly<br />
Are workers of iniquity,<br />
Living on Jehovah&rsquo;s bounty,<br />
Wasting in abject poverty.</p>
<p>A pauper&rsquo;s funeral their end,<br />
No angels waft their souls on high;<br />
Rich they were thought on earth, perhaps,<br />
Yet far from wealth accursed they lie.</p>
<p>Who are the rich?&nbsp; God&rsquo;s Word declares,<br />
The men whose treasure is above&mdash;<br />
Those humble working <i>gentlefolk</i><br />
Whose life flows on in deeds of love.</p>
<p>Despised in life I may remain,<br />
Misunderstood by rich and poor;<br />
An entrance yet I hope to gain<br />
To wealthy plains on endless shore.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>No
paupers in that heavenly land,<br />
The sons of God are rich indeed;<br />
His daughters all His treasures share;<br />
It will their highest hopes exceed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those paupers who are &lsquo;saved&rsquo; are rewarded by material
comforts such as graced the earthly home of Georgiana herself, one of
the &lsquo;humble working <i>gentlefolk</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; She enjoys
her own fireside with an almost Pecksniffian relish, and she profoundly
observes, as she sits beside her hearth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Like forest trees men rise and grow:<br />
Good timber some will prove,<br />
Others decayed as fuel piled,<br />
Prepared are for that stove</p>
<p>That burns for ever, Tophet called,<br />
Heated by jealous heat,<br />
Adapted to destroy all chaff,<br />
And leaves unscorched the wheat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent Georgiana!&nbsp; She could not stand very much chaff of
any kind, I suspect.</p>
<p>The alarming progress of ritualism in the &rsquo;eighties disturbed
her considerably, though it inspired some of her more weighty verses.&nbsp;
<!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>They
should be favourites with Dr. Clifford and Canon Hensley Henson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Some men in our days cover over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A body deformed with their sin:<br />
A cross worked in various colours,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetting that God looks within.</p>
<p>Alas! in our churches at present<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Simplicity seems quite despised;<br />
To represent things far above us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are heathenish customs revived.</p>
<p>This evil is spreading among us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where will it end, can you tell?<br />
Join not with the misled around us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take warning, my readers . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The veneration of the Blessed Virgin goaded her into composition
of stanzas unparalleled in the whole literature of Protestantism:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My readers, can you nowhere see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A parallel to Israel&rsquo;s sin?<br />
The House of God, at home, abroad:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Idols are there</i>&mdash;that house within.</p>
<p>Who incense burns? are strange cakes made?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What woman&rsquo;s chapel, decked with gold,<br />
Stands full of unchecked worshippers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like those idolaters of old?</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>The
Blessed Virgin&mdash;blest she is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That does not make her Heaven&rsquo;s Queen!<br />
Yet some are taught to worship her;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What else does all this teaching mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What she denied to the Mother of God she accorded (rather daringly,
I opine) to one Harriet, whose death and future are recorded in the
following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Declining like the setting sun<br />
After a course divinely run,<br />
I saw a maiden passing fair<br />
Reposing on an easy chair.</p>
<p>A Bridegroom of celestial mien<br />
Came forth and claimed her for His Queen;<br />
One with His Father on His throne<br />
She lives entirely His own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harrietolatry, I thought, was confined to the members of the defunct
Shelley Society.&nbsp; But every reader will feel the poignant truth
of Mrs. Farrer&rsquo;s view of the Church of England&mdash;truer to-day
than it could have been in the &rsquo;eighties:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Church of England&mdash;grand old ship&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toss&rsquo;d is on a troubled sea!<br />
Her sails are rent, her decks are foul&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mutiny on board must be.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>The
winds of discord howl around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild disputers throw up foam,<br />
From high to low she&rsquo;s beat about;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frighten&rsquo;d some who love her roam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not know if the last word is intended for a pun, but I scarcely
think it is likely.</p>
<p>I would like to reconstruct Mrs. Farrer&rsquo;s home, with its stiff
Victorian chairs, its threaded antimacassars, its pictorial paper-weights,
its wax flowers under glass shades, and the charming household porcelain
from the Derby and Worcester furnaces.&nbsp; There must have been a
sabbatic air of comfort about the dining-room which was soothing.&nbsp;
I can see the engravings after Landseer: &lsquo;The Stag at Bay,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Dignity and Impudence&rsquo;; or those after Martin: &lsquo;The
Plains of Heaven,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Great Day of His Wrath&rsquo;;
and &lsquo;Blucher meeting Wellington,&rsquo; after Maclise.&nbsp; I
can see on each side of the mirror examples of the art of Daguerre,
which have already begun to produce in us the same sentiment that we
get from the early Tuscans; and on the mantelpiece a photograph of Harriet
in a plush frame, the one touch of modernity in a room which was otherwise
severely 1845.&nbsp; Then, on a bookshelf which <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>hung
above the old tea-caddy and cut-glass sugar-bowl, Georgiana&rsquo;s
library&mdash;&lsquo;Line upon Line,&rsquo; &lsquo;Precept upon Precept,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Jane the Cottager,&rsquo; &lsquo;Pinnock&rsquo;s Scripture History,&rsquo;
and a few costly works bound in the style of the Albert Memorial.&nbsp;
The drawing-room, just a trifle damp, must have contained Mr. Hunt&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Light of the World,&rsquo; which Mrs. Farrer never quite learned
to love, though it was a present from a missionary, and rendered fire
and artificial light unnecessary during the winter months.&nbsp; Would
that Mrs. Farrer&rsquo;s home-life had come under the magic lens of
Mr. Edmund Gosse, for it would now be classic, like the household of
Sir Thomas More.</p>
<p>Whatever its attractions, Mrs. Farrer was at times induced to go
abroad, visiting, I imagine, only the Protestant cantons of Switzerland.&nbsp;
She stayed, however, in Paris, which she apostrophises with Sibyllic
candour:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O city of pleasure, what did I see<br />
When passing through or staying in thee.<br />
Bright shone the sun above, blue was the sky,<br />
Everywhere music heard, none seemed to sigh.<br />
Beautiful carriages in Champs Elys&eacute;e<br />
Filled with fair maidens on cushions easy.<br />
<!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Such
was the outer side; what was within?<br />
Most I was often told revelled in sin.<br />
Sad its fate since I left, sadder &rsquo;twill be<br />
If they go on in sin as seen by me.<br />
Let us hope, ere too late, warned by the past,<br />
They may seek pleasures more likely to last,<br />
Or, like to Babylon, it must decline,<br />
And o&rsquo;er its ruins its lovers repine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But London hardly fares much better, in spite of Mrs. Farrer&rsquo;s
own residence, at Campden Hill, if I may hazard the locality:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>To the tomb they must go,<br />
Rich and poor all in woe,<br />
Strange motley throng.<br />
Wealth in its splendour weeps,<br />
Poverty silence keeps;<br />
None last here long. . . .<br />
So much for thee, London.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except in a spiritual sense, her existence was not an eventful one.&nbsp;
It was, I think, the loss of some neighbour&rsquo;s child which suggested:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Nellarina, forced exotic,<br />
Born to bloom in region fair,<br />
Thou wert to me a narcotic,<br />
Hope I did thy lot to share.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Any
near personal sorrow she does not seem to have experienced, I am glad
to say, else she might have regarded it as a grievance the consequences
of which one dares not contemplate; you feel that <i>Some One</i> would
have heard of it in no measured terms.&nbsp; Certainty and content are,
indeed, the dominating notes of her poetry rather than mere commonplace
hope:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I am bound for the land of Beulah,<br />
There all the guests sing Hallelujah.<br />
No longer time here let us squander,<br />
But on the good things promised ponder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be futile to discuss the exact position on Parnassus of
a lady whose throne was secured on a more celestial mountain, even more
difficult of access.&nbsp; But I think we may claim for her an honourable
place in that new Oxford school of poetry of which Professor Mackail
officially knows little, and of which Dr. Warren (the President of Magdalen)
is the distinguished living protagonist.&nbsp; With all her acrid Evangelicalism
she was a good soul, for she was fond of animals and children, and kind
to them both in her own way; so I am sure some of <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>her
dreams have been realised, even if there has reached her nostrils just
a whiff of those tolerating purgatorial fires which, spelt differently,
she believed to be <i>permanently</i> prepared for the vast majority
of her contemporaries.</p>

UP TOP.</h2>
<p>During the closing years of the last century certain critics contracted
a rather depressing habit of numbering men of letters, especially poets,
as though they were overcoats in a cloak-room, or boys competing in
an examination set by themselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;It requires very little
discernment,&rsquo; wrote the late Churton Collins, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1891, &lsquo;to foresee that among the English poets of the present
century the first place will <i>ultimately</i> be assigned to Wordsworth,
the second to Byron, and the third to Shelley.&rsquo;&nbsp; Matthew
Arnold, I fear, was the first to make these unsafe Zadkielian prognostications.&nbsp;
He, if I remember correctly, gave Byron the first place and Wordsworth
the second; but Swinburne, with his usual discernment, observed that
English taste in that eventuality would be in the same state as it was
at the end of the seventeenth century, which firmly believed <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>that
Fletcher and Jonson were the best of its poets.</p>
<p>But when is Ultimately?&nbsp; Obviously not the present moment.&nbsp;
Byron does not hold the rank awarded him by the distinguished critic
in 1891.&nbsp; The cruel test of the auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer has recently
shown that Keats and Shelley are regarded as far more important by those
unprejudiced judges, the book-dealers.&nbsp; Wordsworth, of course,
is still one of the poets&rsquo; poets, and the <i>Spectator</i>, that
Mrs. Micawber of literature, will, of course, never desert him; but
I doubt very much whether he has yet reached the harbour of Ultimately.&nbsp;
His repellent personality has blinded a good many of us to his exquisite
qualities; on the Greek Kalends of criticism, however, may I be there
to see.&nbsp; I shall certainly vote for him if I am one of the examiners&mdash;or
one of the cloak-room attendants.</p>
<p>It was against such kind of criticism that Whistler hurled his impatient
epigram about pigeon-holes.&nbsp; And if it is absurd in regard to painting,
how much more absurd is it in regard to the more various and less friable
substances of literature.&nbsp; By the old ten-o&rsquo;clock <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>rule
(I do not refer to Whistler&rsquo;s lecture), once observed in Board
schools, no scripture could be taught after that hour.&nbsp; Once a
teacher asked his class who was the wisest man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Solomon,&rsquo;
said a little boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Right; go up top,&rsquo; said the teacher.&nbsp;
But there was a small pedant who, while never paying much attention
to the lessons, and being usually at the bottom of the form in consequence,
knew the regulations by heart.&nbsp; He interrupted with a shrill voice
(for the clock had passed the hour), &lsquo;No, sir, please, sir; past
ten o&rsquo;clock, sir . . . Solon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus it is, I fear,
with critics of every generation, though they try very hard to make
the time pass as slowly as possible.</p>
<p>But if invidious distinctions between great men are inexact and tiresome,
I opine that it is ungenerous and ignoble to declare that when a great
man has just died, we really cannot judge of him or his work because
we have been his contemporaries.&nbsp; The caution of obituary notices
seems to me cowardly, and the reviews of books are cowardly too.&nbsp;
We have become Laodiceans.&nbsp; We are even fearful of exposing imposture
in current <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>literature
lest we get into hot water with a publisher.</p>
<p>During a New Year week I was invited by Lord and Lady Lyonesse to
a very diverting house-party.&nbsp; This peer, it will be remembered,
is the well-known radical philanthropist who owed his title to a lifelong
interest in the submerged tenth.&nbsp; Their house, Ivanhoe, is an exquisite
gothic structure not unjustly regarded as the masterpiece of the late
Sir Gilbert Scott: it overlooks the Ouse.&nbsp; Including our hosts
we numbered forty persons, and the personnel, including valets, chauffeurs,
and ladies&rsquo;-maids brought by the guests, numbered sixty.&nbsp;
In all, we were a hundred souls, assuming immortality for the chauffeurs
and the five Scotch gardeners.&nbsp; On January 2nd somebody produced
after dinner a copy of the <i>Petit Parisien</i> relating the plebiscite
for the greatest Frenchman of the nineteenth century; another guest
capped him with the <i>Evening News</i> list.&nbsp; The famous <i>Pall
Mall Gazette</i> Academy of Forty was recalled with indifferent accuracy.&nbsp;
Conversation was flagging; our hostess looked relieved; very soon we
were all playing a <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>variation
of that most charming game, <i>suck-pencil</i>.</p>
<p>At first we decided to ignore the nineteenth century.&nbsp; The ten
greatest living Englishmen were to be named by our votes.&nbsp; Bridge
and billiard players were dragged to the polling-station in the green
drawing-room.&nbsp; Lord Lyonesse and myself were the tellers.&nbsp;
I shivered with excitement.&nbsp; One of the Ultimatelies of Churton
Collins seemed to have arrived: it was G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung&mdash;the
Twilight of the Idols.&nbsp; And here is the result of the ballot, which
I think every one will admit possesses extraordinary interest:</p>
<p>Hall Caine.</p>
<p>Marie Corelli.</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling.</p>
<p>Lord Northcliffe.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Lipton.</p>
<p>Hichens.</p>
<p>Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Barrie.</p>
<p>George Alexander.</p>
<p>Beerbohm Tree.</p>
<p>I ought to add, of course, that the guests were unusually intellectual.&nbsp;
There were our host and hostess, their three sons&mdash;one is a scholar
of King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, another is at Balliol, and a third
is a stockbroker; there were five M.P.&rsquo;s with their wives <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>(two
Liberal Imperialists, two Liberal Unionists, and one real Radical),
a Scotch peer with his wife and an Irish peer without one; a publisher
and his wife; three Academicians; four journalists; an Irish poet, a
horse-dealer, a picture-dealer, another stockbroker, an artist, two
lady novelists, a baronet and his wife, three musicians; and Myself.&nbsp;
I think the only point on which the sincerity of the voting might be
doubted, is the ominous absence of any soldier&rsquo;s name on the list.&nbsp;
Lord Lyonesse, however, is a firm upholder of the Hague Conference:
like myself, he is a pro-Boer, but he will not allow any reference to
military affairs, and I suspect that it was out of deference to his
wishes that the guests all abstained from writing down some names of
our gallant generals.&nbsp; Lord Kitchener, however, obtained nine votes,
and I myself included Christian De Wet; but on discovery of documents
he was ruled out, in spite of my pleading for him on imperialistic grounds.&nbsp;
I thought it rather insular, too, I must confess, that Mr. Henry James
and Mr. Sargent were denied to me because they are American subjects.&nbsp;
My own final list, as pasted in the <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Album
at Ivanhoe, along with others, was as follows:</p>
<p>H. G. Wells.</p>
<p>C. H. Shannon.</p>
<p>Bernard Shaw.</p>
<p>Thomas Hardy.</p>
<p>Lord Northcliffe.</p>
<p>Edmund Gosse.</p>
<p>Andrew Lang.</p>
<p>Oliver Lodge.</p>
<p>Dom Gasquet.</p>
<p>Reginald Turner.</p>
<p>Mine, of course, is the choice of a recluse: a scholar without scholarship,
one who lives remote from politics, newspapers, society, and the merry-go-round
of modern life.&nbsp; Its two chief interests lie in showing, first
how far off I was from getting the prize (a vellum copy of poems, by
our hostess), and secondly, that one name only, that of Lord Northcliffe,
should have touched both the popular and the private imagination!&nbsp;
I regret to say that none of the guests knew the names of Dom Gasquet
or Sir Oliver Lodge.&nbsp; Every one, except the artist, thought C.
H. Shannon was J. J. Shannon, and some of the voters were hardly convinced
that Mr. Lang was still an ornament to contemporary literature.&nbsp;
The prize was awarded to a lady whose list most nearly corresponded
to the result of the general plebiscite.&nbsp; I need not say she <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>was
the wife of the publisher.&nbsp; After some suitable expressions from
Lord Lyonesse, it was suggested that we should poll the servants&rsquo;
hall.&nbsp; Pencils and paper were provided and the butler was sent
for.&nbsp; An hour was given for the election, and at half-past eleven
the ballot papers were brought in on a massive silver tray discreetly
covered with a red silk pocket-handkerchief, and here is the result:</p>
<p>Frank Richardson.</p>
<p>Marie Corelli.</p>
<p>John Roberts.</p>
<p>C. B. Fry.</p>
<p>Eustace Miles.</p>
<p>Robert Hichens.</p>
<p>T. P. O&rsquo;Connor.</p>
<p>Lord Lyonesse.</p>
<p>Dr. Williams (Pink Pills for Pale People).</p>
<p>Hall Caine.</p>
<p>The prize (and this is another odd coincidence) was won by the butler
himself, to whom, very generously, the publisher&rsquo;s wife resigned
the vellum copy of our hostess&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; From a literary
point of view, it is interesting to note that Mr. Frank Richardson is
the only master of <i>belles lettres</i> who is appreciated in the servants&rsquo;
hall!&nbsp; The other names we associate, rightly or wrongly, with something
other than literature.</p>
<p>The following evening I suggested choosing <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the
greatest English names in the nineteenth century (twentieth-century
life being strictly excluded).&nbsp; Every one by this time had caught
the <i>suck-pencil</i> fever.&nbsp; By general consent the suffrage
was extended to the domestics: the electorate being thus one hundred.&nbsp;
And what, you will ask, came of it all?&nbsp; I suggest that readers
should guess.&nbsp; Any one interested should fill up, cut out, and
send this coupon to my own publisher on April the first.</p>

<h2><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>MR.
BENSON&rsquo;S &lsquo;PATER.&rsquo;</h2>
<p>In no other country has mediocrity such a chance as in England.&nbsp;
The second-rate writer, the second-rate painter meets with an almost
universal and immediate recognition.&nbsp; When good mediocrities die,
if they do not go straight to heaven (from a country where the existence
of Purgatory is denied by Act of Parliament), at least they run a very
fair chance of burial in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; &lsquo;De mortuis
nil nisi <i>bonus</i>,&rsquo; in the shape of royalties, is the real
test by which we estimate the authors who have just passed away.&nbsp;
A few of our great writers&mdash;Ruskin and Tennyson, for example&mdash;have
enjoyed the applause accorded to senility by a people usually timid
of brilliancy and strength, when it is contemporary.&nbsp; The ruins
of mental faculties touch our imagination, owing, perhaps, to that tenderness
for antiquity which has preserved for us the remains of Tintern Abbey.&nbsp;
Seldom, however, does a great writer live to <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>find
himself, in the prime of his literary existence, a component part of
English literature.&nbsp; Yet there are happy exceptions, and not the
least of these was Walter Pater.</p>
<p>His inclusion in the <i>English Men of Letters</i> series, so soon
after his death, somewhat dazzled the reviewers.&nbsp; Mr. Benson was
complimented on a daring which, if grudgingly endorsed, is treated as
just the sort of innovation you would expect from the brother of the
author of <i>Dodo</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;To a small soul the age which has
borne it can appear only an age of small souls,&rsquo; says Swinburne,
and the presence of Pater, which rose so strangely beside our waters,
seemed to many of his contemporaries only the last sob of a literature
which they sincerely believed came to an end with Lord Macaulay.</p>
<p>It was a fortunate chance by which Mr. A. C. Benson, one of our more
discerning critics, himself master of no mean style, should have been
chosen as commentator of Pater.&nbsp; Among the plutarchracy of the
present day a not very pretty habit prevails of holding a sort of inquest
on deceased writers&mdash;a reaction against misplaced eulogy&mdash;tearing
them <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>and
their works to pieces, and leaving nothing for reviewers or posterity
to dissipate.&nbsp; From the author of the <i>Upton Letters</i> we expect
sympathy and critical acumen.&nbsp; It is needless to say we are never
disappointed.&nbsp; His book is not merely about a literary man: it
is a work of literature itself.&nbsp; So it is charming to disagree
with Mr. Benson sometimes, and a triumph to find him tripping.&nbsp;
You experience the pleasure of the University Extension lecturer pointing
out the mistakes in Shakespeare&rsquo;s geography, the joy of the schoolboy
when the master has made a false quantity.&nbsp; In marking the modern
discoveries which have shattered, not the value of Pater&rsquo;s criticisms,
but the authenticity of pictures round which he wove his aureoles of
prose, Mr. Benson says: &lsquo;In the essay on Botticelli he is on firmer
ground.&rsquo;&nbsp; But among the first masterpieces winged by the
sportsmen of the new criticism was the Hamilton Palace &lsquo;Assumption
of the Virgin&rsquo; (now proved to be by Botticini), to which Pater
makes one of his elusive and delightful allusions.&nbsp; While the &lsquo;<i>School
of Giorgione</i>,&rsquo; which Mr. Benson thinks a little <i>pass&eacute;</i>
in the light of modern <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>research
is now in the movement.&nbsp; The latest bulletins of Giorgione, Pater
would have been delighted to hear, are highly satisfactory.&nbsp; Pictures
once torn from the altars of authenticity are being reinstated under
the acolytage of Mr. Herbert Cook.&nbsp; A curious and perhaps wilful
error, too, has escaped Mr. Benson&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; Referring to
the tomb of Cardinal Jacopo at San Miniato, Pater says, &lsquo;insignis
forma fui&mdash;his epitaph dares to say;&rsquo; the inscription reads
<i>fuit</i>.&nbsp; But perhaps the <i>t</i> was added by the Italian
Government out of Reference to the English residents in Florence, and
the word read <i>fui</i> in 1871.&nbsp; <i>Troja fuit</i> might be written
all over Florence.</p>
<p>Then some of the architecture at Vezelay &lsquo;typical of Cluniac
sculpture&rsquo; is pure Viollet-le-Duc, I am assured by a competent
authority.&nbsp; A more serious error of Pater&rsquo;s, for it is adjectival,
not a fact, occurs in <i>Apollo in Picardy</i>&mdash;&lsquo;<i>rebellious</i>
masses of black hair.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is the only instance in the
<i>parfait prosateur</i>, as Bourget called him, of a clich&eacute;
worthy of the &lsquo;Spectator.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then it is possible to
differ from Mr. Benson in his criticism of the <i>Imaginary Portraits</i>
(the four fair ovals <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>in
one volume), surely Pater&rsquo;s most exquisite achievement after the
<i>Renaissance</i>.&nbsp; <i>Gaston</i> is the failure Pater thought
it was, and <i>Emerald Uthwart</i> is frankly very silly, though Mr.
Benson has a curious tenderness for it.&nbsp; One sentence he abandons
as absolute folly.&nbsp; The grave psychological error in the story
occurs where the surgeon expresses compunction at making the autopsy
on Uthwart because of his perfect anatomy.&nbsp; Surely this would have
been a source of technical pleasure and interest to a surgeon, much
as a butterfly-collector is pleased when he has murdered an unusually
fine species of lepidoptera.&nbsp; Speaking myself as a vivisector of
some experience, I can confidently affirm that a well-bred golden collie
is far more interesting to operate upon than a mongrel sheep-dog.&nbsp;
Nor can I comprehend Mr. Benson&rsquo;s blame of <i>Denys l&rsquo;Auxerrois</i>
as too extravagant and even unwholesome, when the last quality, so obvious
in <i>Uthwart</i>, he seems to condone.</p>
<p>Again, <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> is a failure by Pater&rsquo;s
own high standard: you would have imagined it seemed so to Mr. Benson.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>Dulness
is by no means its least fault.&nbsp; In scheme it is not unlike <i>John
Inglesant</i>; but how lifeless are the characters compared with those
of Shorthouse.&nbsp; Both books deal with philosophic ideas and sensations;
the incidents are merely illustrative and there is hardly a pretence
of sequence.&nbsp; In the historical panorama which moves behind <i>Inglesant</i>,
there are at least &lsquo;tactile&rsquo; values, and seventeenth-century
England is conjured up in a wonderful way; how accurately I do not know.&nbsp;
In <i>Marius</i> the background is merely a backcloth for mental <i>poses
plastiques</i>.&nbsp; You wonder, not how still the performers are,
but why they move at all.&nbsp; Marcus Aurelius, the delightful Lucian,
even Flavian, and the rest, are busts from the Capitoline and Naples
museums.&nbsp; Their bodies are make-believe, or straw from the loft
at &lsquo;White Nights.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cornelius, Mr. Benson sorrowfully
admits, is a Christian prig, but Marius is only a pagan chip from the
same block.&nbsp; John Inglesant is a prig too, but there is blood in
his veins, and you get, at all events, a Vandyck, not a plaster cast.&nbsp;
The magnificent passages of prose which vest this image make it resemble
<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>the
<i>ex voto</i> Madonnas of continental churches&mdash;a shrine in literature
but not a lighthouse.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder what Pater would have become had he been a Cambridge
man, and if the more strenuous University might have <i>forced</i> him
into greater sympathy with modernity; or if he had been born in America,
as he nearly was, and Harvard acted as the benign stepmother of his
days.&nbsp; Such speculations are not beyond all conjecture, as Sir
Thomas Browne said.&nbsp; I think he would have been exactly the same.</p>
<p>On the occasion of Pater&rsquo;s lecture on Prosper Merim&eacute;e,
his friends gathered round the platform to congratulate him; he expressed
a hope that the audience was able to hear what he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
overheard you,&rsquo; said Oscar Wilde.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, you have a
phrase for everything,&rsquo; replied the lecturer, the only contemporary
who ever influenced himself, Wilde declared.&nbsp; How admirable both
of the criticisms!&nbsp; Pater is an aside in literature, and that is
why he was sometimes overlooked, and may be so again in ages to come.&nbsp;
Though he is the greatest master of style the century produced, he <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>can
never be regarded as part of the structure of English prose.&nbsp; He
is, rather, one of the ornaments, which often last, long after a structure
has perished.&nbsp; His place will be shifted, as fashions change.&nbsp;
Like some exquisite piece of eighteenth-century furniture perchance
he may be forgotten in the attics of literature awhile, only to be rediscovered.&nbsp;
And as Fuseli said of Blake, &lsquo;he is damned good to steal from.&rsquo;&nbsp;
If he uses words as though they were pigments, and sentences like vestments
at the Mass, it is not merely the ritualistic cadence of his harmonies
which makes his works imperishable, but the ideas which they symbolise
and evoke.&nbsp; Pater thinks beautifully always, about things which
some people do not think altogether beautiful, perhaps; and sometimes
he thinks aloud.&nbsp; We overhear him, and feel almost the shame of
the eavesdropper.</p>
<p>Mr. Benson has approached Walter Pater, the man, with almost sacerdotal
deference.&nbsp; He suggests ingeniously where you can find the self-revelation
in <i>Gaston</i> and <i>The Child in the House</i>.&nbsp; This is far
more illuminating than the recollections of personal friends <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>whose
reminiscences are modelled on those of Captain Sumph.&nbsp; Mr. Humphry
Ward remembers Pater only once being angry&mdash;it was in the Common
Room&mdash;it was with X, an elderly man!&nbsp; The subject of the difference
was &lsquo;modern lectures.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Relations between them
were afterwards strained.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Arthur Symons remembers that
he intended to bring out a new volume of <i>Imaginary Portraits</i>.&nbsp;
Fancy that!&nbsp; Really, when friends begin to tell stories of that
kind, I begin to suspect they are trying to conceal something.&nbsp;
Perhaps we have no right to know everything or anything about the amazing
personalities of literature; but Henleys and Purcells lurk and leak
out even at Oxford; and that is not the way to silence them.&nbsp; Just
when the aureole is ready to be fitted on, some horrid graduate (Litter&aelig;
<i>in</i>humaniores) inks the statue.&nbsp; Anticipating something of
the kind, Mr. Benson is careful to insist on the divergence between
Rossetti and Pater, and on page eighty-six says something which is ludicrously
untrue.&nbsp; If self-revelation can be traced in <i>Gaston</i>, it
can be found elsewhere.&nbsp; There are sentences in <i>Hippolytus Veiled</i>,
the <i>Age of the Athletic</i> <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span><i>Prizemen</i>,
and <i>Apollo in Picardy</i>, which not only explode Mr. Benson&rsquo;s
suggestions, but illustrate the objections he urges against <i>Denys
l&rsquo;Auxerrois</i>.&nbsp; They are passages where Pater thinks aloud.&nbsp;
If Rossetti wore his heart on the sleeve, Pater&rsquo;s was just above
the cuff, like a bangle; though it slips down occasionally in spite
of the alb which drapes the hieratic writer not always discreetly.</p>

<h2><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>SIMEON
SOLOMON.</h2>
<p>A good many years ago, before the Rhodes scholars invaded Oxford,
there lingered in that home of lost causes and unpopular names, the
afterglow of the &aelig;sthetic sunset.&nbsp; It was not a very brilliant
period.&nbsp; Professor Mackail and Mr. Bowyer Nichols had left Balliol.&nbsp;
Nothing was expected of either the late Sir Clinton Dawkins or Canon
Beeching; and the authorities of Merton could form no idea where Mr.
Beerbohm would complete his education.&nbsp; Names are more suggestive
than dates and give less pain.&nbsp; Then, as now, there were &lsquo;cultured&rsquo;
undergraduates, and those who were very cultured indeed, read Shelley
and burned incense, would always have a few photographs after Simeon
Solomon on their walls&mdash;little notes of illicit sentiment to vary
the monotony of Burne-Jones and Botticelli.&nbsp; When uncles and aunts
came up for Gaudys and Commem., while &lsquo;Temperantia&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;Primavera&rsquo; <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>were
left in their places, &lsquo;Love dying from the breath of Lust,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Antinous,&rsquo; and other drawings by Solomon with titles from
the Latin Vulgate, were taken down for the occasion.&nbsp; Views of
the sister University, Cambridge took their places, being more appropriate
to Uncle Parker&rsquo;s and Aunt Jane&rsquo;s tastes.&nbsp; More advanced
undergraduates, who &lsquo;knew what things were,&rsquo; possessed even
originals.&nbsp; Now the unfortunate artist is dead his career can be
mentioned without prejudice.</p>
<p>Simeon Solomon was born in 1841.&nbsp; He was the third son of Michael
Solomon, a manufacturer of Leghorn hats, and the first Jew ever admitted
to the Freedom of London.&nbsp; The elder brother, Abraham, became a
successful painter of popular subjects (&lsquo;Waiting for the Verdict&rsquo;
and &lsquo;First and Third Class&rsquo;), and died on the day of his
election to the Academy!&nbsp; Rebecca a sister who was also a painter,
copied with success some of Millais&rsquo;s pictures.&nbsp; At the age
of sixteen Simeon exhibited at the Academy, though beyond a short training
at Leigh&rsquo;s Art School in Newman Street he was almost self-taught.&nbsp;
<!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>He
was an early and intimate friend of the Pre-Raphaelites, with whose
art he had much in common, though it is only for convenience that he
is included in the school.&nbsp; Like Whistler, he was profoundly affected
by the genius of Rossetti.&nbsp; Racial and other causes removed him
from any real affinity to the archaistic moralatarianism of Mr. Holman
Hunt.&nbsp; For obvious reasons the Pre-Raphaelite memoirs are silent
about him, but Burne-Jones was said to have maintained, in after years,
&lsquo;that he was the greatest artist of us all.&rsquo;&nbsp; Throughout
the sixties Solomon was one of those black-and-white draughtsmen whose
contributions to the magazines have made the period famous in English
art.&nbsp; He found ready purchasers for his pictures and drawings,
not only among the well-to-do Hebrew community, such as Dr. Ernest Hart,
his brother&rsquo;s brother-in-law, but with well-known Christian collectors
like Mr. Leathart.&nbsp; He was on intimate terms with Walter Pater,
of whom he executed one of the only two known portraits; and in the
<i>Greek Studies</i> will be found a graceful reference to the &lsquo;young
Hebrew painter&rsquo; whose &lsquo;Bacchus&rsquo; at <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>the
Academy obviously contributed to the &lsquo;gem-like&rsquo; flame of
which we have heard so much.</p>
<p>In a short-lived magazine, the <i>Dark Blue</i>, of July 1871, may
be found a characteristic review by Swinburne of Solomon&rsquo;s strange
rhapsody, <i>A Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep</i>, his only literary
work, now a great rarity.&nbsp; This is the longest, and with one exception
the most interesting, tribute to Solomon ever published.&nbsp; &lsquo;Since
the first years of his early and brilliant celebrity as a young artist
of high imagination, power, and promise,&rsquo; Swinburne says, &lsquo;he
has been at work long enough to enable us to define at least certain
salient and dominant points of his genius . . . I have heard him likened
to Heine as a kindred Hellenist of the Hebrews; Grecian form and beauty
divide the allegiance of his spirit with Hebrew shadow and majesty.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It would be difficult to add anything further, in praise of the unfortunate
artist, to the poet&rsquo;s eloquent eulogy of his friend&rsquo;s talents.&nbsp;
An interesting piece of autobiography is afforded in the same article,
where Swinburne tells us that his <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>own
poem of &lsquo;Erotion,&rsquo; in the first series of <i>Poems and Ballads</i>,
was written for a drawing by Simeon Solomon; and in another number of
the same magazine there appeared &lsquo;The End of the Month,&rsquo;
to accompany a new design of Solomon&rsquo;s, the poem appearing later
in the second series of <i>Poems and Ballads</i>.&nbsp; Very few English
artists&mdash;not even Millais&mdash;began life with fairer prospects.&nbsp;
Thackeray wrote in one of the &lsquo;Roundabout Papers&rsquo; for 1860:
&lsquo;For example, one of the pictures I admired most at the Royal
Academy is by a gentleman on whom I never, to my knowledge, set eyes.&nbsp;
The picture is (346) &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; by S. Solomon.&nbsp; I thought
it finely drawn and composed.&nbsp; It nobly represented to my mind
the dark children of the Egyptian bondage. . . . My newspaper says:
&ldquo;Two ludicrously ugly women, looking at a dingy baby, do not form
a pleasing object,&rdquo; and so good-bye, Mr. S. S.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
beautiful picture, painted when the artist was only nineteen, is now
in the collection of Mr. W. G. Rawlinson, and was seen quite recently
at the Franco-British Exhibition, where those familiar with his work
considered it one of Solomon&rsquo;s masterpieces.&nbsp; <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Very
few students of Thackeray realised, however, that the painter thus singled
out for praise formed the subject of a sordid inquest reported in the
<i>Times</i> of August 18th, 1905.</p>
<p>That Solomon&rsquo;s pictures were at first better known to the public
than those of his now more famous associates is shown by Robert Buchanan
confessing that he had scarcely seen any of their works except those
of Solomon, which he proceeded to attack in the famous <i>The Fleshly
School of Poetry</i>.&nbsp; As a sort of justification of the criticism,
in the early seventies, the extraordinary artist had become a pariah.&nbsp;
He was imprisoned for a short while, and on his release was placed in
a private asylum by his friends.&nbsp; Scandal having subsided, since
he showed no further signs of eccentricity, he was, by arrangement,
sent out to post a letter in order that he might have a chance of quietly
escaping and returning to the practice of his art.&nbsp; He returned
to the asylum in half an hour!&mdash;a proceeding which was almost an
evidence of insanity.&nbsp; He was subsequently officially dismissed,
and from this time went steadily downhill, adding to <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>his
other vices that of intemperance.&nbsp; Every effort was made by friends
and relatives to reclaim him.&nbsp; Studios were taken for him, commissions
were given him, clothes were bought for him.&nbsp; He spent his week-ends
in the lock-up.&nbsp; Several picture-dealers tried giving him an allowance,
but he turned up intoxicated to demand advances, and the police had
to be called in.&nbsp; He was found selling matches in the Mile End
Road and tried his hand at pavement decoration without much success.&nbsp;
The companion of Walter Pater and Swinburne became the associate of
thieves and blackmailers.&nbsp; A story is told that one afternoon he
called for assistance at the house of a well-known artist, a former
friend, from whom he received a generous dole.&nbsp; Observing that
the remote neighbourhood of the place lent itself favourably to burgling
operations, Solomon visited his benefactor the same evening in company
with a housebreaker.&nbsp; They were studying the dining-room silver
when they were disturbed; both were in liquor, and the noise they made
roused the sleepers above.&nbsp; The unwilling host good-naturedly dismissed
them!</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Though
a very delightful book might be made of his life by some one who would
not shirk the difficulties of the subject, it is unnecessary here to
dwell further on a career which belongs to the history of morbid psychology
rather than of painting.&nbsp; After drifting from the stream of social
existence into a Bohemian backwater, he found himself in the main sewer.&nbsp;
This he thoroughly enjoyed in his own particular way, and rejected fiercely
all attempts at rescue or reform.&nbsp; To his other old friends, such
as Burne-Jones and Sir Edward Poynter, there must have been something
very tragic in the contemplation of his wasted talents, for few young
painters were more successful.&nbsp; Any one curious enough to study
his pictures will regret that he was lost to art by allowing an ill-regulated
life to prey upon his genius.&nbsp; He had not sufficient strength to
keep the two things separate, as Shakespeare, Verlaine, and Leonardo
succeeded in doing.&nbsp; At the same time, it is a consolation to think
that he enjoyed himself in his own sordid way.&nbsp; When I had the
pleasure of seeing him last, so lately as 1893, he was extremely cheerful
and not aggressively alcoholic.&nbsp; <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Unlike
most spoilt wastrels with the artistic temperament, he seemed to have
no grievances, and had no bitter stories or complaints about former
friends, no scandalous tales about contemporaries who had remained reputable;
no indignant feeling towards those who assisted him.&nbsp; This was
an amiable, inartistic trait in his character, though it may be a trifle
negative; and for a positive virtue, as I say, he enjoyed his drink,
his overpowering dirt, and his vicious life.&nbsp; He was full of delightful
and racy stories about poets and painters, policemen and prisons, of
which he had wide experience.&nbsp; He might have written a far more
diverting book of memoirs than the average Pre-Raphaelite volume to
which we look forward every year, though it is usually silent about
poor Simeon Solomon.&nbsp; Physically he was a small, red man, with
keen, laughing eyes.</p>
<p>By 1887 he entirely ceased to produce work of any value.&nbsp; He
poured out a quantity of pastels at a guinea apiece.&nbsp; They are
repulsive and ill-drawn, with the added horror of being the shadows
of once splendid achievements.&nbsp; Long after his name could be ever
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>mentioned
except in whispers, Mr. Hollyer issued a series of photographs of some
of the fine early sanguine, Indian ink, and pencil drawings.&nbsp; The
originals are unique of their kind.&nbsp; It is very easy to detect
the unwholesome element which has inspired many of them, even the titles
being indicative: &lsquo;Sappho,&rsquo; &lsquo;Antinous,&rsquo; &lsquo;Amor
Sacramentum.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of the finest, &lsquo;Love dying from
the breath of Lust,&rsquo; of which also he painted a picture, became
quite popular in reproduction owing to the moral which was screwed out
of it.&nbsp; Another, of &lsquo;Dante meeting Beatrice at a Child&rsquo;s
Party,&rsquo; is particularly fascinating.&nbsp; To the present generation
his work is perhaps too &lsquo;literary,&rsquo; and his technique is
by no means faultless; but the slightest drawing is informed by an idea,
nearly always a beautiful one, however exotic.&nbsp; The faceless head
and the headless body of shivering models dear to modern art students
were absent from Solomon&rsquo;s designs.&nbsp; His pigments, both in
water-colour and oils, are always harmonious, pure in tone, and rich
without being garish.&nbsp; We need not try to frighten ourselves by
searching too curiously for hidden meanings.&nbsp; His whole art is,
of <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>course,
unwholesome and morbid, to employ two very favourite adjectives.&nbsp;
His work has always appealed to musicians and men of letters rather
than collectors&mdash;to those who ask that a drawing or a picture should
suggest an idea rather than the art of the artist.&nbsp; Subject with
him triumphs over drawing.&nbsp; He is sometimes hopelessly crude; but
during the sixties, when, as some one said, &lsquo;every one was a great
artist,&rsquo; he showed considerable promise of draughtsmanship.&nbsp;
His pictures are less fantastic than the drawings, and aim at probability,
even when they are allegorical, or, as is too often the case, <i>odd</i>
in sentiment.&nbsp; He is apparently never concerned with what are called
&lsquo;problems,&rsquo; the articulation of forms, or any fidelity to
nature beyond the human frame.&nbsp; Unlike many of the Pre-Raphaelites,
he showed a feeling for the medium of oil.&nbsp; His friends and contemporaries,
with the exception of Millais, and Rossetti occasionally, were always
more at ease with water-colour or gouache, and you feel that most of
their pictures ought to have been painted in <i>tempera</i>, the technique
of which was not then understood.&nbsp; Since Millais was of French
extraction, <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Rossetti
of Italian, and Solomon of Hebrew, I fear this does not get us very
much further away from the old French criticism that the English had
forgotten or never learnt how to paint in oil.&nbsp; It must be remembered
that Whistler, who in the sixties achieved some of his masterpieces,
was an American.</p>
<p>It is strange that Solomon did not allow a sordid existence to alter
the trend of his subjects, for these are always derived from poetry
and the Bible, or from Catholic, Jewish, or Greek Orthodox ritual&mdash;a
strange contrast to the respectable, impeccable painter, M. Degas, the
doyen of European art, nationalist and anti-Semite, who finds beauty
only in brasseries, in the vulgar circus, and in the ghastly wings of
the opera.&nbsp; How far removed from his surroundings are the inspirations
of the artist!&nbsp; I believe J. F. Millet would have painted peasants
if he had been born and spent his days in the centre of New York.&nbsp;
With the life-long friend of M. Degas&mdash;Gustave Moreau&mdash;Solomon
had much in common, but the colour of the English Hebrew is much finer,
and his themes are less monotonous.&nbsp; I can imagine many people
being repelled by <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>this
troubled introspective art, especially at the present day.&nbsp; There
is hardly room for an inverted Watts.&nbsp; At the same time, even those
who from age and training cannot take a sentimental interest in faded
rose-leaves, whose perfume is a little overpowering, may care to explore
an interesting byway of art.&nbsp; For poor Solomon there was no place
in life.&nbsp; Casting reality aside, he stepped back into the riotous
pages of Petronius.&nbsp; Perhaps on the Paris boulevards, with Verlaine
and Bibi la Pur&eacute;e, he might have enjoyed a distinct artistic
individuality.&nbsp; Expeditions conducted by Mr. Arthur Symons might
have been organized in order to view him at some popular caf&eacute;.&nbsp;
Mr. George Moore might have written about him.&nbsp; But in respectable
London he was quite impossible.&nbsp; In the temple of Art, which is
less Calvinistic than artists would have us suppose, he will always
have his niche.&nbsp; To the future English Vasari he will be a real
gold-mine.</p>

<h2><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>AUBREY
BEARDSLEY.</h2>
<p>Middle-aged, middle-class people, with a predilection for medi&aelig;val
art, still believe that subject is an important factor in a picture
or drawing.&nbsp; I am one of the number.&nbsp; The subject need not
be literary or historical.&nbsp; After you have discussed in the latest
studio jargon its carpentry, valued the tones and toned the values,
motive or theme must affect your appreciation of a picture, your desire,
or the contrary, to possess it.&nbsp; That the artist is able to endow
the unattractive, and woo you to surrender, I admit.&nbsp; Unless, however,
you are a pro-Boer in art matters, and hold that Rembrandt and the Boer
school (the greatest technicians who ever lived) are finer artists than
Titian, you will find yourself preferring Gainsborough to Degas, and
the unskilful Whistler to the more accomplished Edouard Manet.&nbsp;
Long ago French critics invented an &aelig;sthetic formula to conceal
that poverty of imagination <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>which
sometimes stares from their perfectly executed pictures, and this was
eagerly accepted by certain Englishmen, both painters and writers.&nbsp;
Yet, when an artist frankly deals with forbidden subjects, the canons
regular of English art begin to thunder; the critics forget their French
accent; the old Robert Adam, which is in all of us, asserts himself;
we fly for the fig-leaves.</p>
<p>I am led to these reflections by the memory of Aubrey Beardsley,
and the reception which his work received, not from the British public,
but from the inner circle of advanced intellectuals.&nbsp; Too much
occupied with the obstetrics of art, his superfluity of naughtiness
has tarnished his niche in the temple of fame.&nbsp; &lsquo;A wish to
<i>&eacute;pater le bourgeois</i>,&rsquo; says Mr. Arthur Symons, &lsquo;is
a natural one.&rsquo;&nbsp; I do not think so; at least, in an artist.&nbsp;
Now much of Beardsley&rsquo;s work shows the <i>&eacute;blouissement</i>
of the burgess on arriving at Montmartre for the first time&mdash;a
weakness he shared with some of his contemporaries.&nbsp; This must
be conceded in praising a great artist for a line which he never drew,
after you have taken the immortal Zero&rsquo;s advice and divested yourself
of the scruples.</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>&lsquo;I
would rather be an Academician than an artist,&rsquo; said Aubrey Beardsley
to me one day.&nbsp; &lsquo;It takes thirty-nine men to make an Academician,
and only one to make an artist.&rsquo;&nbsp; In that sneer lay all his
weakness and his strength.&nbsp; Grave friends (in those days it was
the fashion) talked to him of &lsquo;Dame Nature.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Damn
Nature</i>!&rsquo; retorted Aubrey Beardsley, and pulled down the blinds
and worked by gaslight on the finest days.&nbsp; But he was a real Englishman,
who from his glass-house peppered the English public.&nbsp; No Latin
could have contrived his arabesque.&nbsp; The grotesques of Jerome Bosch
are positively pleasant company beside many of Beardsley&rsquo;s inventions.&nbsp;
Even in his odd little landscapes, with their twisted promontories sloping
seaward, he suggested mocking laughter; and the flowers of &lsquo;Under
the Hill&rsquo; are cackling in the grass.</p>
<p>An essay, which Mr. Arthur Symons published in 1897, has always been
recognised as far the most sympathetic and introspective account of
this strange artist&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; It has been reissued, with additional
illustrations, by Messrs. Dent.&nbsp; Those who welcome it as one of
the most inspiring criticisms from an always <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>inspired
critic, will regret that eight of the illustrations belong to the worst
period of Beardsley&rsquo;s art.&nbsp; Kelmscott dyspepsia following
on a surfeit of Burne-Jones, belongs to the pathology of style; it is
a phase that should be produced by the prosecution, not by the eloquent
advocate for the defence.&nbsp; Moreover, I do not believe Mr. Arthur
Symons admires them any more than I do; he never mentions them in his
text.&nbsp; &lsquo;Le D&eacute;bris d&rsquo;un Po&egrave;te,&rsquo;
the &lsquo;Coiffing,&rsquo; &lsquo;Chopin&rsquo;s Third Ballad,&rsquo;
and those for <i>Salome</i> would have sufficed.&nbsp; With these omissions
the monograph might have been smaller; but it would have been more truly
representative of Beardsley&rsquo;s genius and Mr. Arthur Symons&rsquo;s
taste.</p>
<p>At one time or another every one has been brilliant about Beardsley.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Born Puck, he died Pierrot,&rsquo; said Mr. MacColl in one of
the superb phrases with which he gibbets into posterity an art or an
artist he rather dislikes.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Fra Angelico of Satanism,&rsquo;
wrote Mr. Roger Fry of an exhibition of the drawings.&nbsp; There seems
hardly anything left even for Mr. Arthur Symons to write.&nbsp; Long
<!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>anterior
to these particular fireworks, however, his criticism is just as fresh
as it was twelve years ago.&nbsp; I believe it will always remain the
terminal essay.</p>
<p>The preface has been revised, and I could have wished for some further
revision.&nbsp; Why is the name of Leonard Smithers&mdash;here simply
called <i>a</i> publisher&mdash;omitted, when the other Capulets and
Montagus are faithfully recorded?&nbsp; When no one would publish Beardsley&rsquo;s
work, Smithers stepped into the breach.&nbsp; I do not know that the
<i>Savoy</i> exactly healed the breach between Beardsley and the public,
but it gave the artist another opportunity; and Mr. Arthur Symons an
occasion for song.&nbsp; Leonard Smithers, too, was the most delightful
and irresponsible publisher I ever knew.&nbsp; Who remembers without
a kindly feeling the little shop in the Royal Arcade with its tempting
shelves; its limited editions of <i>5000</i> copies; the shy, infrequent
purchaser; the upstairs room where the roar of respectable Bond Street
came faintly through the tightly-closed windows; the genial proprietor?&nbsp;
In the closing years of the nineteenth century his silhouette reels
(my <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>metaphor
is drawn from a Terpsichorean and Caledonian exercise) across an artistic
horizon of which the <i>Savoy</i> was the afterglow.&nbsp; Again, why
is Mr. Arthur Symons so precise about forgetting the date of Beardsley&rsquo;s
expulsion from the <i>Yellow Book</i>?&nbsp; It was in April 1895, April
10th.&nbsp; A number of poets and writers blackmailed Mr. Lane by threatening
to withdraw their own publications unless the Beardsley Body was severed
from the Bodley Head.&nbsp; I am glad to have this opportunity, not
only of paying a tribute to the courage of my late friend Smithers,
but of defending my other good friend, Mr. John Lane, from the absurd
criticism of which he was too long the victim.&nbsp; He could hardly
be expected to wreck a valuable business in the cause of unpopular art.&nbsp;
Quite wrongly Beardsley&rsquo;s designs had come to be regarded as the
pictorial and sympathetic expression of a decadent tendency in English
literature.&nbsp; But if there was any relation thereto, it was that
of Juvenal towards Roman Society.&nbsp; Never was mordant satire more
evident.&nbsp; If Beardsley is carried away in spite of himself by the
superb invention of <i>Salome</i>, he never forgets his <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>hatred
of its author.&nbsp; It is characteristic that he hammered beauty from
the gold he would have battered into caricature.&nbsp; <i>Salome</i>
has survived other criticism and other caricature.&nbsp; And Mr. Lane
once informed an American interviewer that since that April Fool&rsquo;s
Day poetry has ceased to sell altogether.&nbsp; The bards unconsciously
committed suicide; and the <i>Yellow Book</i> perished in the odour
of sanctity.</p>
<p>Recommending the perusal of some letters (written by Beardsley to
an unnamed friend) published some years ago, Mr. Arthur Symons says:
&lsquo;Here, too, we are in the presence of the real thing.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I venture to doubt this.&nbsp; I do not doubt Beardsley&rsquo;s sincerity
in the religion he embraced, but his expression of it in the letters.&nbsp;
At least, I hope it was insincere.&nbsp; The letters left on some of
us a disagreeable impression, at least of the recipient.&nbsp; You wonder
if this pietistic friend received a copy of the <i>Lysistrata</i> along
with the eulogy of St. Alfonso Liguori and Aphra Behn.&nbsp; A fescennine
temperament is too often allied with religiosity.&nbsp; It certainly
was in Beardsley&rsquo;s case, but I think the other <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>and
stronger side of his character should, in justice to his genius, be
insisted upon, as Mr. Arthur Symons insisted upon it.&nbsp; If we knew
that the ill-advised and unnamed friend was the author of certain pseudo-scientific
and pornographic works issued in Paris, we should be better able to
gauge the unimportance of these letters.&nbsp; Far more interesting
would have been those written to Mr. Joseph Pennell, one of the saner
influences; or those to Aubrey Beardsley&rsquo;s mother and sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was at Arques,&rsquo; says Mr. Arthur Symons . . . &lsquo;that
I had the only serious, almost solemn conversation I ever had with Beardsley.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You can scarcely believe that any of the conversations between the two
were other than serious and solemn, because he approaches Beardsley
as he would John Bunyan or Aquinas.&nbsp; Art, literature and life,
are all to this engaging writer a scholiast&rsquo;s pilgrim&rsquo;s
progress.&nbsp; Beside him, Walter Pater, from whom he derives, seems
almost flippant&mdash;and to have dallied too long in the streets of
Vanity Fair.</p>

<h2><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>ENGLISH
&AElig;STHETICS.</h2>
<p>The law reports in newspapers contain perhaps the only real history
of England that has any relation to truth.&nbsp; Here, too, may be found
indications of current thought, more pregnant than the observations
of historians.&nbsp; They still afford material for the future short
or longer history of the English people by the John Richard Greens of
posterity.&nbsp; This was brought home to me by perusing two cases reported
in the <i>Morning Post</i>, that of Mrs. Rita Marsh and the disputed
will of Miss Browne.&nbsp; I yield to no one in my ignorance of English
law, but I have seldom read judgments which seemed so conspicuously
unfair, so characteristic of the precise minimum of &aelig;sthetic perception
in the English people.</p>
<p>The hostelries of Great Britain are famous for their high charges,
their badly-kept rooms, and loathsome cooking; let me add, their warm
welcome.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward III. there <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>was
legislation on the subject.&nbsp; The colder and cheaper hospitality
of the Continent strikes a chill, I am sometimes told by those familiar
with both.&nbsp; The hotel selected by a certain Mrs. Rita Marsh was
no exception to the ordinary English caravanserai.&nbsp; It was &lsquo;replete
with every comfort.&rsquo;&nbsp; The garden contained an <i>oubliette</i>,
down which Mrs. Marsh, while walking in the evening, inadvertently fell.&nbsp;
On the Continent the <i>oubliettes</i> are inside the house, and you
are ostentatiously warned of their immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp; These
things are managed better in France, if I may say so without offending
Tariff Reformers.</p>
<p>The accident disfigured Mrs. Marsh for life; and for the loss of
unusual personal attractions an English jury awarded her only 500<i>l</i>.&nbsp;
The judge made a joke about it.&nbsp; Mr. Gill was very playful about
her photograph, and every one, except, I imagine, Mrs. Marsh, seems
to have been satisfied that ample justice was done.&nbsp; The hotel
proprietors did not press their counter-claim for a bill of 191<i>l</i>.!&nbsp;
Chivalrous fellows!&nbsp; Still, I can safely say that in France Mrs.
Marsh would have been awarded at least four times that amount; though
if she had <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>been
murdered the proprietors would have only been fined forty francs.&nbsp;
But beauty to its fortunate possessors is more valuable than life itself,
and the story is to me one of the most pathetic I have ever heard.&nbsp;
To the English mind there is something irresistibly comic when any one
falls, morally or physically.&nbsp; It is the basis of English Farce.&nbsp;
Jokes made about those who have never fallen, &lsquo;too great to appease,
too high to appal,&rsquo; are voted bad taste.&nbsp; Caricaturists of
the mildest order are considered irreligious and vulgar if they burlesque,
say, the Archbishop of Canterbury for example; or unpatriotic if they
hint that Lord Roberts did not really finish the Boer War when he professed
to have done so.&nbsp; After Parnell came to grief I remember the Drury
Lane pantomime was full of fire-escapes, and every allusion to the <i>cause
c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> produced roars of laughter.&nbsp; Mr. Justice
Bigham was only a thorough Englishman when he gently rallied the jury
for awarding, as he obviously thought, excessive damages.&nbsp; So little
is beauty esteemed in England.</p>
<p>The case of Miss Browne was also singular.&nbsp; She left a trust
fund &lsquo;for the erection of an <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>ornamental
structure of Gothic design, such as a market cross, tall clock, street
lamp-stand, or all combined, in a central part of London, the plan whereof
shall be offered for open competition, and ultimately decided upon by
the Royal Institute of British Architects.&rsquo;&nbsp; The President
of the Probate Division said <i>he was satisfied that Miss Browne was
not of sound mind, and pronounced against the will</i>, with costs out
of the estate.&nbsp; I wonder what the Royal Institute thinks of this
legal testimonial.&nbsp; It seems almost a pity that some one did not
dispute Sir Francis Chantrey&rsquo;s will years ago on similar grounds.&nbsp;
I suggest to Mr. MacColl that it might still be upset.&nbsp; That would
settle once and for all the question whether the administration of the
bequest has evinced evidence of insanity or not.&nbsp; A recent Royal
Commission left the matter undecided.&nbsp; I do not, however, wish
to criticise trustees, but to defend the memory of Miss Browne (who
may have been eccentric in private life) from such a charge, because
her testamentary dispositions were a trifle &aelig;sthetic.&nbsp; The
will was un-English in one respect: &lsquo;<i>no inscription of my name
shall <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>be
placed on such erection</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Was that the clause which
proved her hopelessly mad?&nbsp; The erection was to be Gothic.&nbsp;
I know Gothic is out of fashion just now.&nbsp; Ruskin is quite over;
the Seven Lamps exploded long ago; but Miss Browne seems to have attended
before her death Mr. MacColl&rsquo;s lectures, knew all about &lsquo;masses&rsquo;
and &lsquo;tones&rsquo; in architecture, and wished particular stress
to be laid on &lsquo;the general outline as seen from a good distance.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This is greeted by some of the papers as particularly side-splitting
and eccentric.&nbsp; Looking at the unlovely streets of London, never
one of the more beautiful cities of Europe, where each new building
seems contrived to go one better in sheer <i>uglitude</i> (especially
since builders of Tube stations have ventured into the Vitruvian arena),
you can easily suppose that poor Miss Browne, with her views about &lsquo;general
outlines seen from a good distance,&rsquo; must have appeared hopelessly
insane.&nbsp; The decision of the court is not likely to encourage any
further public bequests of this kind.&nbsp; I have cut the British Museum
and the National Gallery out of my own will already.&nbsp; And I understand
why Mr. MacColl, <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>with
his passionate pleading for a living national architecture, for official
recognition of past and present English art, is thought by many good
people quite odd.&nbsp; How he managed to attract the notice of any
but the Lunacy Commissioners I cannot conceive.&nbsp; Valued critic,
admired artist, model keeper, I only hope he will attract no further
attention.</p>
<p>Since it is clear that the law assists in blackening reputations
even in the grave, I claim that other Miss Brownes who take advantage
of life, and time by the forelock to put up monuments in the sufficiently
hideous thoroughfares should be pronounced <i>non compos mentis</i>.&nbsp;
The perpetrators of the erection in High Street, Kensington, hard by
St. Mary Abbots, may serve as an example.&nbsp; Inconvenient, vulgar,
inapposite, this should debar even the subscribers from obtaining probate
for their wills.&nbsp; I invoke posthumous revenge, and claim that at
least 500<i>l</i>. damages should be paid as compensation to the nearest
hospital for the <i>indignant</i> blind, as my friend Mr. Vincent O&rsquo;Sullivan
calls them in one of his delightful stories.</p>

and Velasquez will be of the company,&rsquo; or something like Gainsborough&rsquo;s
dying words would have occurred sooner or later.&nbsp; I am persuaded
that we look at the ancient pictures with frosted magnifying-glasses,
<!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>and
stare at the younger men from the wrong end of the binoculars.&nbsp;
It was ever thus; it always will be so.&nbsp; Most of us suspect our
contemporaries or juniors.&nbsp; And they&mdash;<i>les jeunes f&eacute;roces</i>&mdash;are
impatient of their immediate predecessors.&nbsp; <i>Nos p&egrave;res
out toujours tort</i>.&nbsp; Though grandpapa is sometimes quite picturesque;
his waistcoat and old buttons suit us very well.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your Raphael
is not even divine,&rsquo; said Velasquez when he left Rome and that
wonderful <i>p.p.c</i>. card on the Doria.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your Academicians
are not even academic,&rsquo; some of the younger painters and their
champions are saying to-day.</p>
<p>I found, moreover, the epithet &lsquo;independent,&rsquo; to qualify
an entertaining and significant exhibition, misleading.&nbsp; For many
of the items could only be so classified in the sense that they were
independent of Messrs. Agnew and the Royal Academy.&nbsp; Mr. Tonks
and Professor Brown are official instructors at the Slade School in
London; Mr. C. J. Holmes is Keeper of the National Portrait Gallery.&nbsp;
Mr. Gerard Chowne was a professor at Liverpool.&nbsp; Mr. Fry is now
an official at New York; and the majority of the painters belonged to
two <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>distinctive
and <i>dependent</i> groups&mdash;the Glasgow School and the New English
Art Club.&nbsp; Intense individualism is not incompatible with militant
collectivism.&nbsp; The only independent artists, if you except Mr.
Nicholson, were Mr. C. H. Shannon and Mr. Charles Ricketts, who have
always stood apart, being neither for the Royal Academy nor its enemies;
their choice is in their pictures.</p>
<p>I feel it difficult to write of painters for some of whom I acted
showman so long at the Carfax Gallery.&nbsp; I confess that when I heard
they were going to Bond Street my pangs were akin to those of the owner
of a small country circus on learning that his troupe of performing
dogs had been engaged by Mr. Imre Kiralfy or the Hippodrome.&nbsp; A
quondam dealer in ultramontanes, I became an Othello of the trade.&nbsp;
And in their grander quarters (I grieve to say) they looked better than
ever, though I would have chosen another background, something less
expensive and more severe.&nbsp; Yes, they all went through their hoops
gracefully.&nbsp; With one exception, I never saw finer Wilson Steers;
the &lsquo;Sunset&rsquo; might well be hung beside the new Turners,
when <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>the
gulf between ancient and modern art would be almost imperceptible.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;Aliens&rsquo; of Mr. Rothenstein in the cosmopolitan society
of a public picture gallery would hardly appear foreigners, because
they belong to a country where the inhabitants are racy of every one
else&rsquo;s soil.&nbsp; When time has given an added dignity (if that
were possible) to this work, I can realise how our descendants will
laugh at our lachrymose observations on the decadence of art.&nbsp;
The background against which the stately Hebrew figures are silhouetted
is in itself a liberal education for the aged and those who ask their
friends what these modern fellows mean.</p>
<p>When the inhabitants of the unceltiferous portion of these islands
employ the adjective <i>un-English</i> you may be sure there is something
serious on the carpet.&nbsp; It is valedictory, expressive of sorrow
and contempt rather than anger.&nbsp; All the other old favourites of
vituperative must have missed fire before this almost sacred, disqualifying
Podsnappianism is applied to the objectionable person, picture, book,
behaviour, or movement.&nbsp; And when the epithet is brought into action,
in nine cases <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>out
of ten it is aimed at some characteristic essentially, often blatantly,
Anglo-Saxon.&nbsp; Throughout the nineteenth century all exponents of
art and literature not conforming to Fleet Street ideals were voted
un-English; Byron, Shelley, Keats, Swinburne, the Pre-Raphaelites, and,
in course of good time, those artists who formed the New English Art
Club.&nbsp; There was some ground for suspicion of foreign intrigue.&nbsp;
They regarded Mr. Whistler, an American, who flirted with French impressionism,
as a pioneer.&nbsp; Some of their names suggest the magic Orient or
the romantic scenery of the Rhine.&nbsp; But it is not extravagant to
assert that if Mr. Rothenstein had chosen to be born in France or Germany,
instead of in Bradford, his art would have come to us in another form.&nbsp;
In his strength and his weakness he is more English than the English.&nbsp;
Art may have cosmopolitan relations (it is usually a hybrid), but it
must take on the features of the country and people where it grows;
or it may change them, or change the vision of the people of its adoption.&nbsp;
Yet Ruth must not look too foreign in the alien corn, or her values
will get wrong.&nbsp; <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>When
an English artist airs his foreign accent and his smattering of French
pigment his work has no permanent significance.&nbsp; Even Professor
Legros unconsciously assimilated British subjectivity: his Latin rein
has been slackened; his experiments are often literary.</p>
<p>It is an error however to regard the exhibitions of the New English
Art Club as a homogeneous movement, such as that of Barbizon and the
Pre-Raphaelite&mdash;inspired by a single idea or similar group of ideas.&nbsp;
The members have not even the cohesion of Glasgow or defunct Newlyn.&nbsp;
The only thing they have in common, in common originally with Glasgow,
was a distaste for the tenets and ideals of Burlington House.&nbsp;
The serpent (or was it the animated rod?) of the Academy soon swallowed
the sentimentalities of Newlyn, just as the International boa-constrictor
made short work of Glasgow.&nbsp; And the forbidden fruit of an official
Eden has tempted many members of the Club.&nbsp; Others have resigned
from time to time, but with no ill result&mdash;to the Club.&nbsp; Now,
the reason for this is that the members have no dependence on each other,
except for the executive organization <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>of
Mr. Francis Bate.&nbsp; It may be doubted if in their heart of hearts
they admire each other&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; They are intense individualists
(personal friends, maybe, in private life) artistically speaking, on
terms of cutting acquaintance at the Slade.</p>
<p>The mannerism of Professor Legros is still, of course, a common denominator
for the older men, and the younger artists evince a familiarity with
drawing unusual in England, due to the admirable training of Professor
Brown and Mr. Henry Tonks.&nbsp; The Spartan Mr. Tonks may not be able
to make geniuses, but he has the faculty of turning out efficient workmen.&nbsp;
Whether they become members of the Club or drift into the haven of Burlington
House, at all events they <i>can</i> fly and wear their aureoles with
propriety.&nbsp; A society, however, which contains such distinctive
and assertive personalities as Mr. Wilson Steer, Mr. Henry Tonks, Mr.
Augustus John, Mr. William Orpen, Mr. Von Glehn, Mr. MacColl, and Professor
Holmes, cannot possess even such unity of purpose as inspired Mr. Holman
Hunt and his associates of the &rsquo;fifties.&nbsp; The New English
Art Club is <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>simply
an admirably administered association whose members have rather less
in common than is shared by the members of an ordinary political club.&nbsp;
The exhibitions are for this reason intensely interesting.&nbsp; They
cannot be waved aside like mobs, and no comprehensive epigram can do
them even an injustice.</p>
<p>I never knew any painter worthy of the name who paid the smallest
attention to what a critic says, even in conversation.&nbsp; He will
retort; but he will not change his style or regulate his motives to
suit a critic&rsquo;s palate.&nbsp; So may I now mention their faults?&nbsp;
What painter is without fault?&nbsp; Their faults are shared by <i>nearly</i>
all of them; their virtues are their own.&nbsp; I see among them an
absence of any <i>desire</i> for beauty&mdash;for physical beauty.&nbsp;
If the artists have fulfilled a mission in abolishing &lsquo;the sweetly
pretty Christmas supplement kind of work,&rsquo; I think they dwell
too long on the trivial and the ignoble.&nbsp; They put a not very interesting
domesticity into their frames.&nbsp; Rossetti, of course, wheeled about
the marriage couch, but his was itself an interesting object of <i>virtu</i>.&nbsp;
Modern art ceased to express the better aspirations and thoughts of
the day <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>when
modern artists refused to become the servants of the commune, but asserted
themselves as a component part of an intellectual republic.&nbsp; That
is why people only commission portraits, and prefer to buy old masters
who anticipate those better aspirations.&nbsp; Burne-Jones, however,
expressed in paint that longing to be out of the nineteenth century
which was so widespread.&nbsp; Now we are well out of it, the rising
generation does not esteem his works with the same enthusiasm as the
elders.&nbsp; It reads Mr. Wells on the future, and looks into the convex
mirror of Mr. Bernard Shaw; but it does not buy Dubedats to the extent
that it ought to do.&nbsp; The members of the New English Art Club could,
I think, preserve their &aelig;sthetic conscience and yet paint beautiful
things and beautiful people.&nbsp; Mr. Steer has now given them a lead.&nbsp;
I wonder what Mr. Winter&rsquo;s opinion would be?&nbsp; He is the best
salesman in London.</p>
<p>Among dealers, the ancient firm of Messrs. P. &amp; D. Colnaghi,
of which Thackeray writes, is the <i>doyen</i>.&nbsp; That of Messrs.
Agnew is the <i>douane</i>.&nbsp; Here it is that the official seal
must be set before modern paintings can pass onwards <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>to
the Midlands and the middle classes.&nbsp; Well, I felicitate the august
officials on removing a tariff of prejudice; I felicitate the young
artists who, released from the bondage of the Egyptian Hall, can now
enjoy the lighter air, the larger day, the pasturage and patronage of
Palestine.&nbsp; I compliment the fearless collectors, such as Mr. C.
K. Butler, Mr. Herbert Trench, Mr. Daniel, His Honour Judge Evans, the
Leylands and the Leathearts of a latter day, for ignoring contemporary
ridicule and anticipating the verdict, not of passing fashion but of
posterity.&nbsp; As the servant spoke well of his master while wearing
his clothes which were far too big for him, let me congratulate the
Chrysostom of critics, the Origen who has scourged our heresies, Mr.
D. S. MacColl; because the Greeks have entered Troy or the barbarians
the senate-house.&nbsp; <i>Dissolve frigus ligna super foco large reponens</i>,
and let us mix our metaphors.&nbsp; What was Mr. MacColl&rsquo;s Waterloo
was a Canossa for Messrs. Agnew.</p>

HOLMAN HUNT AT THE LEICESTER GALLERIES.</h2>
<p>An enterprising American syndicate was once formed for manufacturing
Stilton cheeses on a large scale; like the pirated Cheddars from similar
sources, enjoyed by members of most London clubs.&nbsp; Various farms
celebrated for their Stiltons were visited, sums of money being offered
for old family recipes.&nbsp; The simple peasants of the district willingly
parted with copies of their heirlooms, for a consideration, to the different
American agents, who, filled with joy, repaired to their London offices
in order to compare notes, and fully persuaded that England was a greener
country than ever Constable painted it.&nbsp; What was their mortification
on discovering that all the recipes were entirely different; they could
not be reconciled even by machinery.&nbsp; So it is with Pre-Raphaelitism;
every critic believes that he knows the great secret, and can always
quote from one of the brotherhood something <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>in
support of his view.&nbsp; At the beginning the brothers meekly accepted
Ruskin&rsquo;s explanation of their existence; his, indeed, was a very
convenient, though not entirely accurate, exposition of their collective
view, if they can be said to have possessed one.&nbsp; How far Ruskin
was out of sympathy with them, indiscreet memoirs have revealed.&nbsp;
An artistic idea, or a group of ideas, must always be broken gently
to the English people, because the acceptance of them necessitates the
swallowing of words.&nbsp; When the golden ladders are let down from
heaven by poets, artists, or critics even; or new spirits are hovering
in the intellectual empyrean, the patriarch public snoring on its stone
pillow wakes up; but he will not wrestle with the angel.&nbsp; He mistakes
the ladders for scaffolding, or some temporary embarrassment in the
street traffic; he orders their instant removal; he writes angry letters
to the papers and invokes the police.&nbsp; After some time Ruskin&rsquo;s
definition of Pre-Raphaelitism was generally accepted, and then the
death of Rossetti produced other recipes for the Stilton cheese, Mr.
Hall Caine being among the grocers.&nbsp; Whatever the correct definition
may <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>be,
ungracious and ungrateful though it is to praise the dead at the expense
of the living, it has to be recognised that among the remarkable group
of painters in which even the minor men were little masters, the greatest
artist of them all was Dante Gabriel Rossetti.&nbsp; &lsquo;By critic
I mean finding fault,&rsquo; says Sir William Richmond; so let us follow
his advice, and avoid technical discussion along with the popular jargon
of art criticism.&nbsp; &lsquo;After staying two or three hours in the
always-delightful Leicester Galleries, let us walk home and think a
little of what we have seen.&rsquo;&nbsp; For the essence of beauty
there is nothing of Mr. Holman Hunt&rsquo;s to compare with Rossetti&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Beloved&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Blue Bower;&rsquo; and you could
name twenty of the poet&rsquo;s water-colours which, for design, invention,
devious symbolism, and religious impulse, surpass the finest of Mr.
Hunt&rsquo;s most elaborate works.&nbsp; Even in the painter&rsquo;s
own special field&mdash;the symbolised illustration of Holy Writ&mdash;he
is overwhelmed by Millais with the superb &lsquo;Carpenter&rsquo;s Shop.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In Millais, it was well said by Mr. Charles Whibley, &lsquo;we were
cheated out of a Rubens.&rsquo;&nbsp; Millais <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>was
the strong man, the great oil-painter of the group, as Rossetti was
the supreme artist.&nbsp; In Mr. Holman Hunt we lost another Archdeacon
Farrar.&nbsp; Then, in the sublimation of uglitude, Madox-Brown, step-father
of the Pre-Raphaelites (my information is derived from a P.R.B. aunt),
was an infinitely greater conjurer.&nbsp; Look at the radiant painting
of &lsquo;Washing of the Feet&rsquo; in the Tate Gallery; is there anything
to equal that masterpiece from the brush of Mr. Holman Hunt?&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Hireling Shepherd&rsquo; comes nearest, but the preacher, following
his own sheep, has strayed into alien corn, and on cliffs from which
is ebbing a tide of nonconformist conscience.&nbsp; Like his own hireling
shepherd, too, he has mistaken a phenomenon of nature for a sermon.</p>
<p>One of the great little pictures, &lsquo;Claudio and Isabella,&rsquo;
proves, however, that <i>once</i> he determined to be a painter.&nbsp;
In the &lsquo;Lady of Shalott&rsquo; he showed himself a designer with
unusual powers akin to those of William Blake.&nbsp; Still, examined
at a distance or close at hand, among his canvases do we find a single
piece of decoration or a picture in the <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>ordinary
sense of the word?&nbsp; My definition of a religious picture is a painted
object in two dimensions destined or suitable for the decoration of
an altar or other site in a church, or room devoted to religious purposes;
if it fails to satisfy the required conditions, it fails as a work of
art.&nbsp; Where is the work of this so-called religious painter which
would satisfy the not exacting conditions of a nonconformist or Anglican
place of worship?&nbsp; You are not surprised to learn that Keble College
mistook the &lsquo;Light of the World&rsquo; for a patent fuel, or that
the background of the &lsquo;Innocents&rsquo; was painted in &lsquo;the
Philistine plain.&rsquo;&nbsp; Who could live even in cold weather with
the &lsquo;Miracle of the Sacred Fire?&rsquo;&nbsp; Give me rather the
&lsquo;Derby Day&rsquo; of Mr. Frith&mdash;admirable and underrated
master.&nbsp; What are they if we cannot place them in the category
of pictures?&nbsp; They are pietistic ejaculations&mdash;tickled-up
maxims in pigment of extraordinary durability&mdash;counsels of perfection
in colour and conduct.&nbsp; Of all the Pre-Raphaelites, Mr. Hunt will
remain the most popular.&nbsp; He is artistically the scapegoat of that
great movement which gave a new impulse <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>to
English art, a scapegoat sent out to wander by the dead seas of popularity.&nbsp;
I once knew a learned German who regretted that none of his countrymen
could paint &lsquo;Alpine scenery&rsquo; as Mr. Hunt has done in the
&lsquo;Scapegoat&rsquo;!&nbsp; Yes, he has a message for every one,
for my German friend, for Sir William Richmond, and myself.&nbsp; He
is a missing link between art and popularity.&nbsp; He symbolises the
evangelical attitude of those who would go to German Reed&rsquo;s and
the Egyptian Hall, but would not attend a theatre.&nbsp; After all,
it was a gracious attitude, because it is that of mothers who aged more
beautifully, I think, than the ladies of a later generation which admired
Whistler or Burne-Jones and regularly attended the Lyceum.&nbsp; When
modern art, the brilliant art of the &rsquo;sixties, was strictly excluded
from English homes except in black and white magazines, engravings from
the &lsquo;Finding of Christ in the Temple&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Light
of the World&rsquo; were allowed to grace the parlour along with &lsquo;Bolton
Abbey,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Stag at Bay,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bl&uuml;cher
meeting Wellington.&rsquo;&nbsp; You see them now only in Pimlico and
St. John&rsquo;s Wood.&nbsp; A friend of mine said <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>he
could never look at the picture of &lsquo;Bl&uuml;cher meeting Wellington&rsquo;
without blushing. . . . Like a good knight and true, Sir William Richmond,
another Bedivere, has brandished Excalibur in the form of a catalogue
for Mr. Hunt&rsquo;s pictures.&nbsp; He offers the jewels for our inspection;
they make a brave show; they are genuine; they are intrinsic, but you
remember others of finer water, Bronzino-like portraits of Mr. Andrew
Lang and Bismarck and many others.&nbsp; Now, you should never recollect
anything during the enjoyment of a complete work of art.</p>
<p>Every one knows the view from Richmond, I should say <i>of</i> Richmond;
it is almost my own . . . Far off Sir Bedivere sees Lyonesse submerged;
Camelot-at-Sea has capitulated after a second siege to stronger forces.&nbsp;
The new Moonet is high in the heaven and a dim Turner-like haze has
begun to obscure the landscape and soften the outlines.&nbsp; Under
cover of the mist the hosts of Mordred MacColl, <i>en-Tat&eacute;</i>
with victory, are hunting the steer in the New English Forest.&nbsp;
Far off the enchanter Burne-Jones is sleeping quietly in Broceliande
(I cannot bear to call it Rottingdean).&nbsp; <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>Hark,
the hunt, (not the Holman Hunt) is up in Caledon (Glasgow); they have
started the shy wilson steer: they have wound the hornel; the lords
of the International, who love not Mordred overmuch, are galloping nearer
and nearer.&nbsp; Sir Bedivere can see their insolent pencils waving
black and white flags: and the game-keepers and beaters (critics) chant
in low vulgar tones:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we came out of Glasgow town<br />
There was really nothing at all to see<br />
Except Legros and Professor Brown,<br />
But <i>now</i> there is Guthrie and Lavery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Undaunted Sir Bedivere drags his burden to a hermitage near Coniston;
but he finds it ruined; he bars the door in order to administer refreshment
to the wounded Pre-Raphaelite; there is a knocking at the wicket-gate;
is it the younger generation?&nbsp; No, he can hear the tread of the
royal sargent-at-arms; his spurs and sword are clanking on the pavement.&nbsp;
Sir Bedivere feels his palette parched; his tongue cleaves to the roof
of St. Paul&rsquo;s; but he is undaunted.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are surely
betrayed if that is really Sargent,&rsquo; he says.&nbsp; Through the
broken tracery of the Italian Gothic window <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>a
breeze or draught comes softly and fans his strong academic arms; he
feels a twinge.&nbsp; Some Merlin told him he would suffer from ricketts
with shannon complications.&nbsp; Seizing Excalibur, he opens the door
cautiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Draw, caitiffs,&rsquo; he cries; &lsquo;draw.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Perhaps they cannot draw; perhaps they are impressionists,&rsquo;
said a raven on the hill; and he flew away.</p>

<h2><!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>THE
ECLECTIC AT LARGE.</h2>
<p>In <i>The Education of an Artist</i>, Mr. Lewis Hind invented a new
kind of art criticism&mdash;a pleasing blend of the Morelli narrative
(minus the scientific method) and <i>Mr. Sponge&rsquo;s Sporting Tour</i>.&nbsp;
He contrives a young man, ignorant like the Russian, Lermoliev, who
receives certain artistic impressions, faithfully recorded by Mr. Hind
and visualised for the reader in a series of engaging half-tone illustrations.&nbsp;
The hero&rsquo;s name is itself suggestive&mdash;Claude Williamson Shaw.&nbsp;
By the end of the book he is nearly as learned as Mr. Claude Phillips:
he might edit a series of art-books with all the skill of Dr. Williamson,
and his power of racy criticism rivals that of Mr. George Bernard Shaw.&nbsp;
You can hardly escape the belief that these three immortals came from
the north and south, gathered as unto strife, breathed upon his mouth
and filled his body&mdash;with ideas: Mr. Hind supplying the life.&nbsp;
<!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>But
this is not so: the ideas are all Mr. Hind&rsquo;s and the godfathers
only supplied the name.&nbsp; What a name it is to be sure!&nbsp; It
recalls one of Ibsen&rsquo;s plays: &lsquo;Claude Williamson Shaw was
a miner&rsquo;s son&mdash;a Cornish miner&rsquo;s son, as you know;
or perhaps you didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He was always wanting <i>plein-air</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Some one ought to say that in the book, but I must say it instead.&nbsp;
At all events, Mr. Hind nearly always refers to him by his three names,
and every one must think of him in the same way, otherwise side issues
will intrude themselves&mdash;thoughts of other things and people.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O Captain Shaw, type of true love kept under,&rsquo; is not inapposite,
because Claude Williamson Shaw fell in love with a lady who in a tantalising
manner became a religious in one of the strictest Orders, the rules
of which were duly set forth in old three-volume novels; that is the
only conventional incident in the book.&nbsp; C. W. S., although he
trains for painting, is admitted by Mr. Hind to be quite a bad artist.&nbsp;
Apart, therefore, from the admirable criticism which is the main feature
of the book, it shows great courage on the part of the inventor, great
sacrifice, to admit <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>that
C. W. S. <i>was</i> a failure as an artist.&nbsp; Bad artists, however,
are always nice people.&nbsp; I do not say that the reverse is true;
indeed, I know many good and even great artists who are charming; but
I never met a thoroughly inferior painter (without any promise of either
a future or a past) who was not irresistible socially.&nbsp; This accounts
for some of the elections at the Royal Academy, I believe, and for the
pictures on the walls of your friends whose taste you know to be impeccable.&nbsp;
There is more hearty recognition of bad art in England than the Tate
Gallery gives us any idea of.</p>
<p>I know that the Chantrey Trustees were deprived of the only possible
excuse for their purchases by the finding of Lord Lytton&rsquo;s Commission;
but I, for one, shall always think of them as kindly men with a fellow-feeling
for incompetence, who would have bought a work by Claude Williamson
Shaw if the opportunity presented itself.&nbsp; I have sometimes tried
to imagine what the pictures of <i>invented</i> artists in fiction or
drama were really like&mdash;I fear they were all dreadful performances.&nbsp;
I used to imagine that Oswald <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>Avling
was a sort of Segantini, but something he says in the play convinced
me that he was merely another Verboekhoven.&nbsp; Then Thackeray&rsquo;s
Ridley must have been a terrible Philistine&mdash;a sort of Sir John
Gilbert.&nbsp; Poor Basil Hallward&rsquo;s death was no great loss to
art, I surmise: his portrait of &lsquo;Dorian Grey, Esq.&rsquo;, from
all accounts, resembled the miraculous picture exhibited in Bond Street
a short while ago.&nbsp; I am not surprised that its owner, whose taste
improved, I suspect, with advancing years, destroyed it in the ordinary
course after reading something by Mr. D. S. MacColl.&nbsp; It is distinctly
stated that Dorian read the <i>Saturday Review</i>!&nbsp; Frenhofer,
Hippolite Schimier, and Leon de Lora were probably chocolate-box painters
of the regular second-empire type.&nbsp; Theobald, we know from Mr.
Henry James, was a man of ideas who could not carry out his intentions.&nbsp;
It must have been an exquisite memory of Theobald&rsquo;s failures which
made Pater, when he wished to contrive an imaginary artistic personality,
take Watteau as being some one in whose achievements you can believe.&nbsp;
No literary artist can persuade us into admiring <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>pictures
which never existed; though an artist can reconstruct from literature
a picture which has perished we know, from the &lsquo;Calumny of Apelles&rsquo;
by Botticelli.&nbsp; It was, therefore, wise to make Claude Williamson
Shaw a failure as a painter.&nbsp; In accordance with my rule he was
an excellent fellow, nearly as charming as his author, and better company
in a picture-gallery it would be difficult to find&mdash;and you cannot
visit picture-galleries with every friend: you require a sympathetic
personality.&nbsp; It is the Claude&mdash;the Claude Phillips in him
which I like best: the Dr. Williamson I rather suspect.&nbsp; I mean
that when he was at Messrs. Chepstow, the publishers, he must have mugged
up some of the real Dr. Williamson&rsquo;s art publications.&nbsp; Whether
in the Louvre, or National Gallery, or in Italian towns, he always goes
for the right thing; sometimes you wish he would make a mistake.&nbsp;
Bad artists, of course, are often excellent judges of old pictures and
make excellent dealers, and I am not denying the instinct of C. W. S.;
but I cannot think it all came so naturally as Mr. Hind would indicate.</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>The
reason why Claude Williamson Shaw discovered &lsquo;that he would not
find a true expression of his temperament&rsquo; in painting readers
of this ingenious book will discover for themselves.&nbsp; Assuming
that he had any innate talent, I do not think he went about the right
way to cultivate it.&nbsp; His friend Lund gave him the very worst advice;
though we are the gainers.&nbsp; It is quite unnecessary to go out of
England and gaze at a lot of pictures of entirely different schools
in order to become a painter.&nbsp; Gainsborough and our great Norwich
artists evolved themselves without any foreign study.&nbsp; There was
no National Gallery in their days.&nbsp; A second-rate Wynants and a
doubtful Hobbema seem to have been enough to give them hints.&nbsp;
It would be tedious to mention other examples.&nbsp; The fortunate meeting
of Zuccarelli and Wilson at Venice is the only instance I know in which
foreign travel benefited any English landscape painter.&nbsp; Foreign
travel is all very well when the artist has grown up.&nbsp; Paris has
been the tomb of many English art students.&nbsp; M. Bordeaux, who gave
Mr. Hind&rsquo;s hero tips in the atelier, seems to have been as &lsquo;convincing&rsquo;
as <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>the
famous barrel of the same name.&nbsp; Far better will the English student
be under Mr. Tonks at the Slade; or even at the Royal Academy, where,
owing to the doctrine of contraries, out of sheer rebellion he may become
an artist.&nbsp; In Paris you learn perfect carpentry, but not art,
unless you are a born artist; but in that case you will be one in spite
of Paris, not because of it.&nbsp; But if C. W. Shaw had been a real
painter he would have seen at Venice certain Tiepolos which seem to
have escaped him, and in other parts of Italy certain Caravaggios.&nbsp;
Yes, and Correggios and Guido Renis, too hastily passed by.&nbsp; He
was doomed to be a connoisseur.</p>

<h2><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>EGO
ET MAX MEUS.</h2>
<p>&lsquo;How very delightful Max&rsquo;s drawings are.&nbsp; For all
their mad perspective and crude colour, they have, indeed, the sentiment
of style, and they reveal with rarer delicacy than does any other record
the spirit of Lloyd-George&rsquo;s day.&rsquo;&nbsp; This sentence is
not quite original: it is adapted from an eminent author because the
words sum up so completely the inexpressible satisfaction following
an inspection of Mr. Beerbohm&rsquo;s caricatures.&nbsp; To-day essentially
belongs to the Minister who once presided at the Board of Trade.&nbsp;
Several attempts indeed have been made to describe the literature, art
and drama of the present as &lsquo;Edwardian,&rsquo; from a very proper
and loyal spirit, to which I should be the last to object.&nbsp; We
were even promised a few years ago a new style of furniture to inaugurate
the reign&mdash;something to supplant that Louis Dix-neuvi&egrave;me
<i>d&eacute;cor</i> which is merely a compromise <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>with
the past.&nbsp; But somehow the whole thing has fallen through; in this
democratic &aelig;on the adjective &lsquo;Edwardian&rsquo; trips on
the tongue; our real dramatists are all Socialists or Radicals; our
poets and writers Anarchists.&nbsp; Our artists are the only conservatives
of intellect.&nbsp; Our foreign policy alone can be called &lsquo;Edwardian,&rsquo;
so personal is it to the King.&nbsp; Everything else is a compromise;
so our time must therefore be known&mdash;at least ten years of it&mdash;as
the Lloyd-Georgian period.&nbsp; I can imagine collectors of the future
struggling for an <i>alleged</i> genuine work of art belonging to this
brief renaissance, and the disappointment of the dealer on finding that
it dated a year before the Budget, thereby reducing its value by some
thousands.</p>
<p>Just as we go to Kneller and Lely for speaking portraits of the men
who made their age, so I believe our descendants will turn to Max for
listening likenesses of the present generation.&nbsp; Of all modern
artists, he alone follows Hamlet&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp; If the mirror
is a convex one, that is merely the accident of genius, and reflects
the malady of the century.&nbsp; <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Other
artists have too much eye on the Uffizi and the National Gallery (the
more modest of them only painting up to the Tate).&nbsp; In Max we have
one who never harks forward to the future, and is therefore more characteristic,
more Lloyd-Georgian than any of his peers.&nbsp; Set for one moment
beside some Rubens&rsquo; goddess a portrait by Mr. Sargent, and how
would she be troubled by its beauty?&nbsp; Not in the slightest degree;
because they are both similar but differing expressions of the same
genius of painting.&nbsp; The centuries which separate them are historical
conventions; and in Art, history does not count; &aelig;sthetically,
time is of no consequence.&nbsp; But in the more objective art of caricature,
history is of some import, and (as Mr. Beerbohm himself admitted about
photographs) the man limned is of paramount importance.&nbsp; Actual
resemblance, truthfulness of presentation, criticism of the model become
legitimate subjects for consideration.&nbsp; Generally speaking, artists
long since wisely resigned all attempts at catching a likeness, leaving
to photography an inglorious victory.&nbsp; Mr. Beerbohm, realising
this fact, seized caricature <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>as
a substitute&mdash;the consolation, it may be, for a lost or neglected
talent.&nbsp; It is as though Watts (painter of the soul&rsquo;s prism,
if ever there was one) had pushed away Ward and Downey from the camera,
to insert a subtler lens, a more sensitive negative.</p>

<p>If, reader, you have ever been to a West-end picture shop, you will
have suffered some annoyance on looking too attentively at any item
in the exhibition, by the approach of an officious attendant, who presses
you to purchase it.&nbsp; He begins by flattery; he felicitates you
on your choice of the <i>best</i> picture in the room&mdash;the one
that has been &lsquo;universally admired by critics and collectors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fact of its not being sold is due (he na&iuml;vely confesses)
to its rather high price; several offers have been submitted, and if
not sold at the catalogued amount the artist has promised to consider
them; but it is very unlikely that the drawing will remain long without
a red ticket, &lsquo;<i>as people come back to town to-morrow</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There is the stab, the stab in the back while you were drinking honey;
the tragedy of <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Corfe
Castle repeated.&nbsp; <i>People with</i> a capital <i>P</i> in picture-dealing
circles does not mean what they call the <i>Hoypolloy</i>; it means
the great ones of the earth, the <i>monde</i>, the Capulets and Montagues
with wealth or rank.&nbsp; You have been measured by the revolting attendant.&nbsp;
He does not count you with them, or you would not be in town to-day;
something has escaped you in the <i>Morning Post</i>, some function
to which you were not invited, or of which you knew nothing.&nbsp; If
you happen to be a Capulet you feel mildly amused, and in order to correct
the wrong impression and let the underling know your name and address
you purchase the drawing; for the greatest have their weak side.&nbsp;
But, if not, and you have simply risen from the &lsquo;purple of commerce,&rsquo;
you are determined not to lag behind stuck-up Society; you will revenge
yourself for the thousand injuries of Fortunatus; you will deprive him
of his prerogative to buy the <i>best</i>.&nbsp; The purchase is concluded.&nbsp;
You go home with your nerves slightly shaken from the gloved contest&mdash;you
go home to face your wife and children, wearing a look of wistful inquiry
on their irregular upturned faces, as <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>when
snow lies upon the ground, they scent Christmas, and you look up with
surprise at the whiteness of the ceiling.&nbsp; Though in private life
a contributor to the press, in public I used to be one of those importunate
salesmen.</p>
<p>It was my duty, my pleasurable duty, so to act for Mr. Beerbohm&rsquo;s
caricatures when exhibited at a fashionable West-end gallery where among
the visitors I recognised many of his models.&nbsp; I observe that when
Mr. Beerbohm is a friend of his victim he is generally at his best;
that he is always excellent and often superb if he is in sympathy with
the personality of that victim, however brutally he may render it.&nbsp;
His failures are due to lack of sympathy, and they are often, oddly
enough, the mildest as caricatures.&nbsp; Fortunately, Mr. Beerbohm
selects chiefly celebrities who are either personal friends or those
for whom he must have great admiration and sympathy.&nbsp; By a divine
palmistry he estimates them with exquisite perception.&nbsp; I noted
that those who were annoyed with their own caricature either did not
know Mr. Beerbohm or disliked his incomparable writings; and, curiously
enough, <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>he
misses the likeness in people he either does not know personally or
whom you suspect he dislikes.&nbsp; I am glad now of the opportunity
of being sincere, because it was part of my function as salesman to
agree with what every one said, whether in praise or in blame.</p>
<p>And let me reproduce a conversation with one of the visitors.&nbsp;
It is illustrative:&mdash;</p>

<h2><!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>THE
ETHICS OF REVIEWING.</h2>
<p>The &lsquo;Acropolis,&rsquo; a review of literature, science, art,
politics, society, and the drama, is, as every one knows, our leading
literary weekly.&nbsp; Its original promoters decided on its rather
eccentric title with a symbolism now outmoded.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Acropolis&rsquo;
was to be impregnable to outside contributors, and the editor was always
to be invisible.&nbsp; All the vile and secret arts of r&eacute;clame
and puffery were to find no place in its immaculate pages.&nbsp; One
afternoon some time ago a number of gentlemen, more or less responsible
for the production of the &lsquo;Acropolis,&rsquo; were seated round
the fire in the smoking-room of a certain club.&nbsp; For the last hour
they had been discussing with some warmth the merits of signed or unsigned
articles and the reviewing of books.&nbsp; A tall, good-looking man,
who pretended to be unpopular, was advocating the anonymous.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
is something so cowardly about a signed article,&rsquo; he was saying.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is nearly <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>as
bad as insulting a man in public, when there is no redress except to
call for the police.&nbsp; And that is ridiculous.&nbsp; If I am slated
by an anonymous writer, it is always in my power to pay no attention,
whereas if the slate is signed, I am obliged to take notice of some
kind.&nbsp; I must either deny the statements, often at a great sacrifice
of truth, or if I assault the writer there is always the risk of his
being physically stronger than I am.&nbsp; No; anonymous attack is the
only weapon for gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To leave for a moment the subject of anonymity,&rsquo; said
an eminent novelist, &lsquo;I think the great curse of all criticism
is that of slating any book at all.&nbsp; Think of the unfortunate young
man or woman first entering the paths of literature, and the great pain
it causes them.&nbsp; You should encourage them, and not damp their
enthusiasm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; said North, &lsquo;I encourage no one,
and writers should never have any feelings at all.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t
have any, or they would not bore the public by writing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The discussion was getting heated when the editor, Rivers, interfered.</p>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>&lsquo;My
dear North,&rsquo; he began, addressing the first speaker, &lsquo;your
eloquent advocacy of the anonymous reminds me of a curious incident
that occurred many years ago when I was assistant-editor of the &ldquo;Acropolis.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The facts were never known to the public, and my old chief, Curtis,
met with much misplaced abuse in consequence.&nbsp; There were reasons
for which he could never break silence; but it happened so long ago
that I cannot be betraying any confidence.&nbsp; All of you have heard
of, and some of you have seen, Quentin Burrage, whose articles practically
made the &ldquo;Acropolis&rdquo; what it now is.&nbsp; His opinion on
all subjects was looked forward to by the public each week.&nbsp; Young
poetasters would tremble when their time should come to be pulverised
by the scathing epigrams which fell from his anonymous pen.&nbsp; Essayists,
novelists, statesmen were pale for weeks until a review appeared that
would make or mar their fame.&nbsp; In the various literary coteries
of London no one knew that Quentin Burrage was the slater who thrilled,
irritated, or amused them, though he was of course recognised as an
occasional contributor.&nbsp; The secret was well kept.&nbsp; He <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>was
practically critical censor of London for ten years.&nbsp; A whole school
of novelists ceased to exist after three of his notices in the &ldquo;Acropolis.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The names of painters famous before his time you will not find in the
largest dictionaries now.&nbsp; Four journalists committed suicide after
he had burlesqued their syntax, and two statesmen resigned office owing
to his masterly examination of their policy.&nbsp; We were all much
shocked when a popular actor set fire to his theatre on a first night
because Curtis and his dramatic critic refused to take champagne and
chicken between the acts.&nbsp; This may give you some idea of Burrage&rsquo;s
power in London for a decade of the last century.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day a curious change came over him.&nbsp; It was Monday
when he and I were in the office receiving our instructions.&nbsp; Curtis,
after going over some books, handed to Quentin a vellum-covered volume
of poems, saying with a grim smile: &ldquo;There are some more laurels
for you to hash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An expression of pain spread over Quentin&rsquo;s serene features.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do,&rdquo; he said wearily.&nbsp;
But his curious manner struck both Curtis and <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>myself.&nbsp;
The book was a collection of very indifferent verse which already enjoyed
a wide popularity.&nbsp; I cannot tell you the title, for that is a
secret not my own.&nbsp; It was early work of one of our most esteemed
poets who for some time was regarded by <i>his friends</i> as the natural
successor to Mr. Alfred Austin.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Acropolis&rdquo; had
not spoken.&nbsp; We were sometimes behindhand in our reviews.&nbsp;
The public waited to learn if the new poet was really worth anything.&nbsp;
You may imagine the general surprise when a week afterwards there appeared
a flamingly favourable review of the poems.&nbsp; It made a perfect
sensation and was quoted largely.&nbsp; The public became quite conceited
with its foresight.&nbsp; The reputation of the poet was assured.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Snarley-ow must be dead,&rdquo; some one remarked in my hearing
at the club, and members tried to pump me.&nbsp; One day a telegram
came from Curtis asking me to go down to his house at once.&nbsp; A
request from him was a command.&nbsp; I found him in a state of some
excitement, his manner a little artificial.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear Rivers,
I suppose you think me mad.&nbsp; The geese have got into the Capitol
at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without correcting his <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>classical
allusion, I said: &ldquo;Where is Burrage?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
coming here presently.&nbsp; Of course, I glanced at the thing in proof,
and thought it a splendid joke, but reading it this morning, I have
come to the conclusion that something is wrong with Burrage.&nbsp; You
remember his agitated manner the other day?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was about
to reply, when Burrage was announced.&nbsp; His haggard and pale appearance
startled both of us.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear Burrage, what <i>is</i> the
matter with you?&rdquo; we exclaimed simultaneously.&nbsp; He gave a
sickly nervous smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course you have sent to ask me
about that review.&nbsp; Well, I have changed my opinions, I have altered.&nbsp;
I think we should praise everything or ignore everything.&nbsp; To slate
a book, good or bad, is taking the bread out of a fellow&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;
I have been the chief sinner in this way, and I am going to be the first
reformer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not in my paper,&rdquo; said Curtis, angrily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we all fell to discussing that old question with all
the warmth that North and the rest of you were doing just now.&nbsp;
We lost our tempers and Curtis ended the matter by saying: &ldquo;I
tell you what it is, Burrage, if you <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>ever
bring out a book yourself I&rsquo;ll send it to you to review.&nbsp;
You can praise it as much as you like.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t let this
occur again, with any one else&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Burrage turned
quite white, I thought, and Curtis, noticing the effect of his words,
went up and taking him by the hand, added more kindly, &ldquo;My poor
Burrage, are you quite well?&nbsp; I never saw you in so morbid a state
before.&nbsp; All this is mere sentimentality&mdash;so different from
your usual manly spirit.&nbsp; Go away for a change, to Brighton or
Eastbourne, and you must come back with that wholesome contempt for
your contemporaries that characterises most of your writings.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll look over the matter this time, and we&rsquo;ll say no more
about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here Curtis was so overcome that he dashed
a tear from his eye.&nbsp; A few hours later I saw Burrage off to the
sea.&nbsp; He was very strange in his manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
never be quite the same again.&nbsp; If I only dared to tell you,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; And the train rolled out of the station.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some weeks later I was again in the editorial room and Curtis
showed me a curiously bound book, printed on hand-made paper, entitled
<i>Prejudices</i>.&nbsp; I had already <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>seen
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;That book,&rdquo; Curtis remarked, &ldquo;ought to
have been noticed long ago.&nbsp; I was keeping it for Burrage when
he gets better.&nbsp; Shall I send it to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Prejudices</i> for some weeks had been the talk of London.&nbsp;
It was a series of very ineffectual essays on different subjects.&nbsp;
Sight, Colour, Sound, Art, Letters, and Religion were all dealt with
in that highly glowing and original manner now termed <i>Style</i>.&nbsp;
It was delightfully unwholesome and extraordinarily silly.&nbsp; Young
persons had already begun to get foolish over it, and leaving the more
stimulating pages of Mr. Pater they hailed the work as an earnest of
the English Renaissance.&nbsp; Instead of stroking <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>
they fondled a copy of <i>Prejudices</i>.&nbsp; I prophesied that Burrage
would vindicate himself over it and that the public would hear very
little of <i>Prejudices</i> in a year&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; The book was
sent; and the first part of my prophecy was fulfilled, Burrage spared
neither the author nor his admirers.&nbsp; The pedantry, the affected
style, the cheap hedonism were all pitilessly exposed.&nbsp; London,
rocked with laughter.&nbsp; Some of the admirers, with the <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>generosity
of youth, nobly came to the rescue.&nbsp; They made a paper war and
talked of &ldquo;The cruelty and cowardice of the attack,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
stab in the dark,&rdquo; &ldquo;Journalistic marauding,&rdquo; &ldquo;Disappointed
author turned critic.&rdquo;&nbsp; The slate was one that I am bound
to say was <i>killing</i> in both senses of the word.&nbsp; A book less
worthless could never have lived under it.&nbsp; It was one of those
decisive reviews of all ages.&nbsp; <i>Prejudices</i> was withdrawn
by the publisher fearful of damaging his prestige.&nbsp; Yet it was
never looked on as a rarity, and fell at book auctions for a shilling,
for some time after, amidst general tittering.&nbsp; The daily papers
meanwhile devoted columns to the discussion.&nbsp; I telegraphed to
Burrage in cipher and congratulated him, knowing that secrets leak out
sometimes through the post office.&nbsp; I was surprised to get no reply
for some weeks, but Curtis said he was lying low while the excitement
lasted.&nbsp; One day I got a letter simply saying, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
sake come.&nbsp; I am very ill.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went at once.&nbsp; How
shall I describe to you the pitiful condition I found him in?&nbsp;
The doctor told me he was suffering from incipient tuberculosis due
to cerebral excitement and <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>mental
trouble.&nbsp; When I went in to see him he was lying in bed, pale and
emaciated as a corpse, surrounded by friends and relations.&nbsp; He
asked every one to go out of the room; he had something of importance
to say to me.&nbsp; I then learned what you have divined already.&nbsp;
The anonymous author of <i>Prejudices</i> was no other than Quentin
Burrage himself.&nbsp; Or rather not himself, but the other self of
which neither I nor Curtis knew anything.&nbsp; He had been living a
double existence.&nbsp; As a writer of trashy essays and verse, an incomplete
sentimentalist surrounded by an admiring band of young ladies and gentlemen,
he was not recognised as the able critic and the anonymous slater of
the &ldquo;Acropolis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When he first received his own book for review he recalled
the words of Curtis.&nbsp; He must be honest, impartial, and just.&nbsp;
No one knew better the faults of <i>Prejudices</i>.&nbsp; As he began
to write, the old spirit of the slater came over him.&nbsp; His better
self conquered.&nbsp; He forgot for the moment that he was the author.&nbsp;
He hardly realised the sting of his own sarcasms even when he saw them
in proof.&nbsp; <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>It
was not until it appeared, and the papers were full of the controversy,
that the <i>cruelty</i> and <i>unfairness</i> of the attack dawned on
him.&nbsp; I was much shocked at the confession, and the extraordinary
duplicity of Burrage, who had been living a lie for the last ten years.&nbsp;
His denunciation of poor Curtis pained me.&nbsp; I would have upbraided
him, but his tortured face and hacking cough made me relent.&nbsp; I
need not prolong the painful story.&nbsp; Burrage never recovered.&nbsp;
He sank into galloping consumption, only aggravated by a broken heart.&nbsp;
I saw him on his deathbed at Rome.&nbsp; He was attended by Strange,
and died in his arms.&nbsp; His last words to me were, &ldquo;Rivers,
tell Curtis I forgive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We buried in the Protestant cemetery near Keats and Shelley
one whose name was written in hot water.&nbsp; His sad death provoked
a good deal of comment, as you may suppose.&nbsp; Strange has often
promised to write his life.&nbsp; But he could never get through <i>Prejudices</i>,
and I pointed out to him that you can hardly write an author&rsquo;s
life without reading one of his works, even though he did die in your
arms.&nbsp; That is the worst of literary <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>martyrs
with a few brilliant exceptions: their works are generally dull.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; asked North.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all, and I hope you understand the moral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly; but your reminiscences have too much construction,
my dear Rivers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The story is perfectly true for all that,&rsquo; remarked
the Editor, drily.</p>

LITTLE DOCTORED FAUST.&nbsp; A Prologue.</h2>
<p>&lsquo;The version of <i>Faust</i> which Mr. Stephen Phillips is
contemplating will, it is interesting to learn from the author, be a
&ldquo;compact drama,&rdquo; of which the spectacular embellishment
will form no part.&nbsp; In Mr. Phillips&rsquo;s view the story is in
itself so strong and so rich in all the elements that make for dramatic
effectiveness that to treat the subject as one for elaborate scenic
display would be to diminish the direct appeal of a great tragedy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;First let me say,&rdquo; said Mr. Stephen Phillips, &ldquo;how
gladly I approach a task which will bring me again into association
with Mr. George Alexander, whose admirable treatment of <i>Paolo and
Francesco</i>, you will no doubt remember.&nbsp; In the version of <i>Faust</i>
which I am going to prepare there will be nothing spectacular, nothing
to overshadow or intrude upon an immortal theme.&nbsp; As to how I shall
treat the story, and as to the form in which it will be written, I am
not yet sure&mdash;it may be a play in blank verse, or in prose with
lyrics . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Phillips added that he had also in view

For poets to refuse you anything,<br />

And tasted all the joys of literature<br />

I thank you, gentlemen, with all my heart;<br />
I thank you, gentlemen, with all my soul;<br />
I thank you, sirs, with all my soul and strength.<br />
So for your leave much thanks.&nbsp; You know my weakness:<br />
I love to be at peace with all the past.<br />
The present and the future I can manage;<br />

you have told us what you are,<br />

Who must be damned in any case, I fear.</p>
<p>S. P.&nbsp; Of course, I treat you as material<br />
On which to work; but then I simplify<br />
And purify the story for our stage.<br />
The English stage is nothing if not pure.<br />
For instance, we will not allow <i>Salom&eacute;</i>.<br />
So in Act II. of <i>Faust</i> I represent<br />
The marriage feast of beauteous Margaret;<br />
Act I. I get from Goethe, III. from Marlowe,<br />
And Gounod&rsquo;s music fills the gaps in mine.<br />
Margaret, of course, will never come to grief.<br />
She only gets a separation order.<br />
By the advice of Plowden magistrate,<br />
She undertakes to wean Euphorion,<br />
Who in his bounding habit symbolises<br />
The future glories of the English empire.<br />
As the production must not cost too much,<br />
Harker, Hawes Craven, Hann are relegated<br />
To a back place.&nbsp; It is a compact drama,<br />
Of which spectacular embellishment<br />
<!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>Will
form no part.&nbsp; The story is so strong,<br />
So rich in all the elements that make<br />
A drama suitable for Alexander,<br />
That scenery, if necessary to Tree,<br />
Shall not intrude on this immortal theme.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goethe</span>.&nbsp; Pyramidal!&nbsp; My friend,
but you are splendid.<br />
Now, have you shown the manuscript to Colvin?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marlowe</span>.&nbsp; He is a scholar, and a
ripe and good one,<br />
And far too tolerant of modern poets.</p>

my familiar spirit.<br />
Surely, that does not come from Stephen Phillips.</p>

All that they need are complimentary stalls,<br />
To know the leading actor, to be round<br />
At dress rehearsals, or behind the scenes,<br />
To hear the row the actor-manager<br />
Had with the author or the leading lady,<br />
Then to recount the story at the Garrick,<br />

this evening to make a few observations on flogging in the Navy, Vaccination,
the Censor, Vivisection, the Fabian Society, the Royal Academy, Compound
Chinese Labour, Style, Simple Prohibition, Vulgar Fractions, and other
kindred subjects.&nbsp; But as I opened the paper this morning, my eye
caught these headlines: &lsquo;Future of the House of Lords,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Mr. Edmund Gosse at home,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Nerves of Lord Northcliffe,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Interview with Mr. Winston Churchill,&rsquo; &lsquo;Reported
Indisposition of Miss Edna May.&rsquo;&nbsp; A problem was thus presented
to me.&nbsp; Will I, shall I, ought I to speak to my friends <i>here</i>&mdash;ahem!&mdash;and
elsewhere, on the subject about which they came to hear me speak.&nbsp;
(<i>Applause</i>.)&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I said; the bounders must be disappointed;
otherwise <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>they
will know what to expect.&nbsp; You must always surprise your audience.&nbsp;
When it has been advertised (sufficiently) that I am going to speak
about the truth, for example, the audience comes here expecting me to
speak about fiction.&nbsp; The only way to surprise them is to speak
the truth and that I always do.&nbsp; Nothing surprises English people
more than truth; they don&rsquo;t like it; they don&rsquo;t pay any
attention to those (such as my friend Mr. H. G. Wells and myself) who
<i>trade</i> in truth; but they listen and go away saying, &lsquo;How
very whimsical and paradoxical it all is,&rsquo; and &lsquo;What a clever
adventurer the fellow is, to be sure.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That was a
good joke about duty and beauty being the same thing&rsquo;&mdash;that
was a joke I did <i>not</i> make.&nbsp; It is not my kind of joke&mdash;but
when people begin ascribing to you the jokes of other people, you become
a living&mdash;I was going to say statue&mdash;but I mean a living classic.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Devil</span>.&nbsp; I thought you disliked
anything classic?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Statue</span>.&nbsp; Ahem! only <i>dead</i>
classics&mdash;especially when they are employed to protect romanticism.&nbsp;
Dead classics are the protective <!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>tariffs
put on all realism and truth by bloated idealism.&nbsp; In a country
of plutocrats, idealism keeps out truth: idealism is more expensive,
and therefore more in demand.&nbsp; In America, there are more plutocrats,
and therefore more idealists . . . as Mr. Pember Reeves has pointed
out in New Zealand . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Devil</span>.&nbsp; But I say, is this drama?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Statue</span>.&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp;
It is a discussion taking place at a theatre.&nbsp; It is no more drama
than a music-hall entertainment, or a comic opera, or a cinematograph,
or a hospital operation, all of which things take place in theatres.&nbsp;
But surely it is more entertaining to come to a discussion charmingly
mounted by Ricketts&mdash;discussion too, in which every one knows what
he is going to say&mdash;than to flaccid plays in which the audience
always knows what the actors <i>are</i> going to say better often than
the actors.&nbsp; The sort of balderdash which Mr. --- serves up to
us for plays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A New Epilogue for the Last Performance of Mr.
Shaw&rsquo;s Play</span>.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Bernard Shaw has set the fashion in prologues for modern
plays, his admirers were not altogether satisfied with the epilogue
to <i>The Doctor&rsquo;s Dilemma</i>.&nbsp; It is far too short; and
leaves us in the dark as to whom &lsquo;Jennifer Dubedat&rsquo; married.&nbsp;
Epilogues, as students of English drama remember, were often composed
by other authors.&nbsp; The following experiment ought to have come
from the hand of Mr. St. John Hankin, that master of Dramatic Sequels,
but his work on the &lsquo;Cassilis Engagement&rsquo; deprived Mr. Shaw
of the only possible collaborator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. Stepney</span>.&nbsp; I thought all the pictures

<p><span class="smcap">Gersaint</span>.&nbsp; So they were, my boy,

<p><i>Scene: The Smoking-room of the Elivas Club</i>.</p>
<p><i>Characters</i>: <span class="smcap">Laudator Temporeys</span>,
<i>&aelig;tat. 54, a distinguished literary critic, and</i> <span class="smcap">Luke
Cullus</span>, <i>a rich connoisseur of art and life.&nbsp; They are
not smoking nor drinking spirits.&nbsp; One is sipping barley water,
the other Vichy</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke Cullus</span>.&nbsp; You are a dreadful
pessimist!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laudator Temporeys</span>.&nbsp; Alas! there
is no such thing in these days.&nbsp; We are merely disappointed optimists.&nbsp;
When Walter Pater died I did not realise that English literature expired.&nbsp;
Yet the event excited hardly any interest in the Press.&nbsp; Our leading
weekly, the <i>Spectator</i>, merely mentioned that Brasenose College,
Oxford, had lost an excellent Dean.</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; I can hardly understand you.&nbsp; Painting, I admit,
is entirely a lost art, so far as England is concerned.&nbsp; The death
of Burne-Jones <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>brought
our tradition to an end.&nbsp; I see no future for any of the arts except
needlework, of which, I am told, there is a hopeful revival.&nbsp; But
in your fields of literature, what a number of great names!&nbsp; How
I envy you!</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; Who is there?</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; Well, to take the novelists first: you have the great
Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, Maurice Hewlett
. . . I can&rsquo;t remember the names of any others just at present.&nbsp;
Then take the poets: Austin Dobson, my own special favourite; and among
the younger men, A. E. Housman, Laurence Housman, Yeats, Arthur Symons,
Laurence Binyon, William Watson&mdash;</p>
<p>L. T. (<i>interrupting</i>).&nbsp; Who always keeps one foot in Wordsworth&rsquo;s
grave.&nbsp; But all the men you mention, my dear Cullus, belong to
the last century.&nbsp; They have done their best work.&nbsp; Hardy
has become mummy, and Henry James is sold in Balham.&nbsp; Except Hardy,
they have become unintelligible.&nbsp; The theory that &lsquo;to be
intelligible is to be found out&rsquo; seems to have frightened them.&nbsp;
The <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>books
they issue are a series of &lsquo;not-at-home&rsquo; cards&mdash;sort
of P.P.C.&rsquo;s on posterity.&nbsp; And the younger poets, too, belong
to the last century, or they stand in the same relation to their immediate
predecessors, to borrow one of your metaphors, as <i>l&rsquo;art nouveau</i>
does to Chippendale.&nbsp; Oh, for the days of Byron, Keats, and Shelley!</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; All of whom died before they were matured.&nbsp; You
seem to resent development.&nbsp; In literature I am a mere <i>dilettante</i>.&nbsp;
A fastidious reader, but not an expert.&nbsp; I know what I don&rsquo;t
like; but I never know what I shall like.&nbsp; At least twice a year
I come across a book which gives me much pleasure.&nbsp; As it comes
from the lending library it is never quite new.&nbsp; That is an added
charm.&nbsp; If it happens to have made a sensation, the sensation is
all over by the time it reaches me.&nbsp; The book has matured.&nbsp;
A quite new book is always a little crude.&nbsp; It suggests an evening
paper.&nbsp; There at least you will agree.&nbsp; But to come across
a work which Henry James published, say, last year, is, I assure you,
like finding a Hubert Van Eyck in the Brompton Road.</p>
<p><!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>L.
T.&nbsp; I wish I could share your enthusiasm, or that I could change
places with you.&nbsp; Every year the personality of a new artist is
revealed to you.&nbsp; I know you only pretend not to admire the modern
school of painting.&nbsp; You find it a convenient pose.&nbsp; Your
flora and your fauna are always receiving additions; while my garden
is withered; my zoo is out of repair.&nbsp; The bars are broken; the
tanks have run dry.&nbsp; There is hardly a trace of life except in
the snake-house, and, as I mentioned, the last giraffe is dead.</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; Our friend, Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, is fortunately able
to give us a different account of the institution in Regent&rsquo;s
Park.&nbsp; You are quite wrong about modern painting.&nbsp; None of
the younger men can paint at all.&nbsp; A few of them can draw, I admit.&nbsp;
It is all they can do.&nbsp; The death of Charles Furse blasted all
my hopes of English art.&nbsp; Whistler is dead; Sargent is an American.</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; Well, so is Henry James, if it comes to that.&nbsp; And
so <i>was</i> Whistler.&nbsp; But I have seen the works of several young
artists who I understand are carrying out the great traditions of painting.&nbsp;
Ricketts, Shannon, Wilson <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>Steer,
Rothenstein, Orpen, Nicholson, Augustus John are surely worthy successors
to Turner, Alfred Stevens, and the Pre-Raphaelites.</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; They are merely connoisseurs gifted with expressing their
appreciation of the past in paint.&nbsp; They appeal to you as a literary
man.&nbsp; You like to detect in every stroke of their brushes an echo
of the past.&nbsp; Their pictures have been <i>heard</i>, not <i>seen</i>.&nbsp;
All the younger artists are committing burglary on the old masters.</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; It is you who are a disappointed optimist.</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; Not about literature or the drama.&nbsp; I seem to hear,
with Ibsen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Master Builder,&rsquo; the younger generation
knocking at the door.</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; It comes in without knocking in my experience; and generally
has <i>fig</i>-leaves in its hair&mdash;a decided advance on the coiffure
of Hedda Gabler&rsquo;s lover.</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; But look at Bernard Shaw.</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; Why should I look at Bernard Shaw?&nbsp; I read his plays
and am more than ever convinced that he has gone on the wrong lines.&nbsp;
His was the opportunity.&nbsp; He made <i>il gran</i> <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span><i>refuto</i>.&nbsp;
Some one said that George Saintsbury never got over the first night
of <i>Hernani</i>.&nbsp; Shaw never recovered the <i>premi&egrave;re</i>
of <i>Ghosts</i>.&nbsp; He roofed our Thespian temple with Irish slate.&nbsp;
His disciples found English drama solid brick and leave it plaster of
Paris.&nbsp; Yet Shaw might have been another Congreve.</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; <i>Troja fuit</i>.&nbsp; We do not want another.&nbsp;
I am sure you never went to the Court at all.</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; Oh, yes, I attended the last <i>lev&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp;
But the drama is too large a subject, or, in England, too small a subject
to discuss.&nbsp; We live, as Professor Mahaffy has reminded us, in
an Alexandrian age.&nbsp; We are wounded with arch&aelig;ology and exquisite
scholarship, and must drag our slow length along . . . We were talking
about literature.&nbsp; Where are the essayists, the Lambs, and the
Hazlitts?&nbsp; I know you are going to say Andrew Lang; I say it every
day; it is like an Amen in the Prayer-book; it occurs quite as frequently
in periodical literature.&nbsp; He <i>was</i> my favourite essayist,
during the <i>last</i> fifteen years of the <i>last</i> century.&nbsp;
What is he now?&nbsp; An historian, a folk-lorist, an arch&aelig;ologist,
a controversialist.&nbsp; <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>I
believe he is an expert on portraits of Mary Stuart.&nbsp; You were
going on to say G. K. Chesterton&mdash;</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I was going to say Max Beerbohm.&nbsp; Some
of his essays I put beside Lamb&rsquo;s, and above Hazlitt&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He has style; but then I am prejudiced because he is the only modern
artist I really admire.&nbsp; He is a superb draughtsman and our only
caricaturist.&nbsp; Then there is George Moore.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
care for his novels, but his essays are delightful.&nbsp; George Moore
really counts.&nbsp; Few people know so little about art; yet how delightfully
he writes about it.&nbsp; Everything comes to him as a surprise.&nbsp;
He gives you the same sort of enjoyment as you would derive from hearing
a nun preach on the sins of smart society.</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; Moore is one of many literary Acteons who have mistaken
Diana for Aphrodite.</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; You mean he is great dear; but he gets hold of the right
end of the stick.</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; And he generally soils it.&nbsp; But you know nothing
about literature.&nbsp; The age requires blood and Kipling gave it Condy&rsquo;s
Fluid (<i>drinks barley water</i>).&nbsp; The age requires <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>life,
and Moore gave us a gallantee show from Montmartre (<i>drinks barley
water</i>).&nbsp; Even I require life.&nbsp; To-morrow I am off to Aix.</p>
<p>L. C.&mdash;les Bains?</p>
<p>L. T.&nbsp; No, la-Chapelle!</p>
<p>L. C.&nbsp; Oh, then we shall probably meet.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;
I can get on my own overcoat.&nbsp; I shall probably be there myself
in a few weeks.</p>
<h2><!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>ABBEY
THOUGHTS.</h2>
<p>Shall some memorial of Herbert Spencer be erected in the Abbey, or
rather in what journalists love to call the &lsquo;National Valhalla,&rsquo;
the &lsquo;English Pantheon,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;venerable edifice,&rsquo;
where, as Macaulay says, the dust of the illustrious accusers, <i>et
cetera</i>&mdash;&mdash;?&nbsp; The question was once agitated in a
daily paper.&nbsp; It seems that the Dean, when approached on the subject,
acted like one of his predecessors in the case of Byron.&nbsp; The Dean
is in a very difficult position, because any decision of his must be
severely criticised from one quarter or another.&nbsp; The Abbey retains,
I understand, some of its pre-Reformation privileges, and is not under
the jurisdiction of Bishop or Archbishop.&nbsp; Yet no one who has ever
visited the Chapel of St. Edward the Confessor on October 13th, the
festival of his translation, can accuse the Abbey authorities of bigotry
or narrow-mindedness.&nbsp; Only a few years ago I fought my way, with
<!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>other
Popish pilgrims, to the shrine of our patron Saint (as he <i>was</i>,
until superseded by Saint George in the thirteenth century), and there
I indulged in overt acts of superstition violating Article XXII. of
&lsquo;the Church of England by law established.&rsquo;&nbsp; A verger,
with some colonial tourists, arrived during our devotions, but his voice
was lowered out of regard for our feelings.&nbsp; Indeed, both he and
the tourists adopted towards us an attitude of respectful curiosity
(not altogether unpleasant), which was in striking contrast to the methods
of the continental <i>Suisse</i> routing out worshippers from a side
chapel of a Catholic church in order to show Baedeker-ridden sightseers
an altar-piece by Rotto Rotinelli.</p>
<p>Thoughts of Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley irresistibly mingled with
my devotions.&nbsp; What had the poor fellows burnt for, after all?&nbsp;
Here we were ostentatiously ignoring English history and the adjacent
Houses of Parliament; outraging the rubrics by ritual observations for
which poor curates in the East End are often suspended, and before now
have been imprisoned.&nbsp; I could not help thinking that the Archbishop
of Westminster would hardly <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>care
to return these hospitalities, by permitting, on August 24th, a memorial
service for Admiral Coligny in Westminster Cathedral. . . . I rose from
my knees a new Luther, with something like a Protestant feeling, and
scrutinised severely the tombs in Poets&rsquo; Corner.&nbsp; Even there
I found myself confronted with an almost irritating liberalism.&nbsp;
Here was Alexander Pope, who rejected all the overtures of Swift and
Atterbury to embrace the Protestant faith.&nbsp; And there was Dryden,
not, perhaps, a great ornament to my persuasion, but still a Catholic
at the last.&nbsp; Dean Panther had not grudged poet Hind his niche
in the National Valhalla (I knew I should be reduced to that periphrasis).&nbsp;
And here was the mighty Charles Darwin, about whose reception into the
English Pantheon (I have fallen again) I remember there was some trouble.&nbsp;
Well, if precedent embalms a principle, I venture to raise a thin small
voice, and plead for Herbert Spencer.&nbsp; &lsquo;The English people,&rsquo;
said a friendly French critic, &lsquo;do not admire their great men
because they were great, but because they reflect credit on themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So on the score of national vanity <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>I
claim space for Herbert Spencer.&nbsp; Very few Englishmen have exercised
such extraordinary influence on continental opinion, which Beaconsfield
said was the verdict of posterity.&nbsp; On the news of his death, the
Italian Chamber passed a vote of condolence with the English people.&nbsp;
I suppose that does not seem a great honour to Englishmen, but to me,
an enemy of United Italy, it seemed a great honour, not only to the
dead but to the English people.&nbsp; Can you imagine the Swiss Federal
Council sending us a vote of condolence on the death of Mr. Hall Caine
or Mr. Robert Hichens?</p>
<p>Again, though it is ungrateful of me to mention the fact after my
experiences of October 13th, the Abbey was not built nor endowed by
people who anticipated the Anglican form of worship being celebrated
within its walls, though I admit it has been <i>restored</i> by the
adherents of that communion.&nbsp; The image of Milton, to take only
one instance, would have been quite as objectionable to Henry III. or
Abbot Islip as those of Darwin or Spencer.&nbsp; The emoluments bequeathed
by Henry VII. and others for requiem masses are now devoted to the education
<!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>of
Deans&rsquo; daughters and Canons&rsquo; sons.&nbsp; Where incensed
altars used to stand, hideous monuments of the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries wound the Gothic air with their monstrous ornaments
and inapposite epitaphs.&nbsp; St. Paul&rsquo;s may fairly be held sacred
to Anglicanism, and I do not think any one would claim sepulture within
its precincts for one who was avowedly hostile to Christian or Anglican
sentiment.&nbsp; But I think the Abbey has now passed into the category
of museums, and might well be declared a national monument under control
of the State.&nbsp; The choir, and possibly the nave, should, of course,
be severely preserved for whatever the State religion might be at the
time.&nbsp; Catholics need not mourn the secularisation of the transepts
and chapels, because Leo XIII. renounced officially all claims on the
ancient shrines of the Catholic faith, and High Churchmen might console
themselves by recalling the fact that Abbots were originally laymen.</p>
<p>My whole scheme would be a return to the practice of the Primitive
Church, when priests were only allowed on sufferance inside abbeys <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>at
all.&nbsp; The Low Church party need not be considered, because they
can have no sentiment about what they regard as relics of superstition
and Broad Churchmen could hardly complain at the logical development
of their own principle.&nbsp; The Nonconformists, the backbone of the
nation, could not be otherwise than grateful.&nbsp; The decision about
admitting busts, statues, or bodies into the national and sacred &lsquo;mus&eacute;e
des morts&rsquo; (as the anti-clerical French might call it under the
new constitution) would rest with the Home Secretary.&nbsp; This would
be an added interest to the duties of a painstaking official, forming
pleasant interludes between considering the remission of sentences on
popular criminals: it would relieve the Dean and Chapter at all events
from grave responsibility.&nbsp; The Home Secretary would always be
called the Abbot of Westminster.&nbsp; How picturesque at the formation
of a new Cabinet&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Home Secretary and Abbot of Westminster</i>,
the Right Hon. Mr. So-and-So.&rsquo;&nbsp; The first duty of the Abbot
will be to appoint a Royal Commission to consider the removal of hideous
monuments which disfigure the edifice: nothing prior to 1700 coming
<!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>under
its consideration.&nbsp; A small tablet would recall what has been taken
away.&nbsp; Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s claim to a statue would be duly
considered, and, I hope, by a unanimous vote some of the other glaring
gaps would be filled up.&nbsp; If the Abbey is full of obscurities,
very dim religious lights, many of the illustrious names in our literature
have been omitted: Byron, Shelley, Keats&mdash;to mention only these.&nbsp;
There is no monument to Chatterton, one of the more powerful influences
in the romantic movement, nor to William Blake, whose boyish inspiration
was actually nourished amid that &lsquo;Gothic supineness,&rsquo; as
Mr. MacColl has finely said of him.&nbsp; Of all our poets and painters
Blake surely deserves a monument in the grey church which became to
him what St. Mary Redcliffe was to Chatterton.&nbsp; A window adapted
from the book of Job (with the marvellous design of the Morning Stars)
was, I am told, actually offered to, and rejected by, the late Dean.&nbsp;
To Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the wonderful movement of which he was
the dynamic force there should also be a worthy memorial; to Water Pater,
the superb aside of English prose; to Cardinal Manning, <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span><i>the</i>
Ecclesiastic of the nineteenth century; and Professor Huxley, that master
of dialectics.</p>
<p>A young actor of my acquaintance, who bore the honoured name of Siddons,
was invited to take part in the funeral service of the late Sir Henry
Irving.&nbsp; His step-father was connected by marriage with the great
actress, and he was very proud of his physical resemblance to her portrait
by Reynolds.&nbsp; He had played with great success the part of Fortinbras
in the provinces, and Mr. Alexander has assured me that he was the ideal
impersonator of Rosencrantz.&nbsp; It was an open secret that he had
refused Mr. Arthur Bourchier&rsquo;s offer of that <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
in a proposed revival of <i>Hamlet</i> at the Garrick.&nbsp; Since the
burial of Sir Henry Irving in the Abbey, <i>he has never been seen</i>:
though I saw him myself in the funeral <i>cort&eacute;ge</i>.&nbsp;
All his friends remember the curious exaltation in his manner a few
days before the ceremony, and I cannot help thinking that in a moment
of enthusiasm, realising that this was his only chance of burial in
the Abbey, he took advantage of the bowed unobservant heads during the
prayer of Committal and crept beneath the pall into the great actor&rsquo;s
tomb.&nbsp; What his <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>feelings
were at the time, or afterwards when the vault was bricked up, would
require the introspective pen of Mr. Henry James and the curious imagination
of Mr. H. G. Wells to describe.&nbsp; I have been assured by the vergers
that mysterious sounds were heard for some days after this historical
occasion.&nbsp; Distressed by the loss of my friend, I applied to the
Dean of Westminster and finally to Scotland Yard.&nbsp; I need not say
that I was met with sacerdotal indifference on the one hand and with
callous officialism on the other.&nbsp; I hope that under the Royal
Commission which I have appointed the mystery will be cleared up.&nbsp;
Not that I begrudge poor Siddons a niche with Garrick and Irving.</p>

<h2><!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>THE
ELETHIAN MUSE.</h2>
<p>After chaperoning into Fleet Street the eleventh Muse, the rather
Batavian lady who is not to be found in that Greek peerage, Lempriere&rsquo;s
Dictionary, an obliging correspondent from Edinburgh (an eminent writer
to the Signet in our northern Thebes) inquired if there were any more
muses who had escaped the students of comparative mythology.&nbsp; It
is in response to his letter that I now present, as Mr. Charles Frohman
would say, the thirteenth, the Elethian Muse.</p>
<p>Yet I can fancy people asking, Where is the twelfth, and over what
art or science does she preside?&nbsp; According to Apollodorus (in
a recently recovered fragment from Oxyrynchus), Jupiter, suffering from
the chronic headaches consequent on his acrimonious conversations with
Athena, decided to consult Vulcan, &AElig;sculapius having come to be
regarded as a quack.&nbsp; Mulciber (as we must now call him, <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>having
used the name Vulcan once), suggested an extraordinary remedy, one of
the earliest records of a hom&oelig;opathic expedient.&nbsp; He prescribed
that the king of gods and men should keep his ambrosial tongue in the
side of his cheek for half an hour three times a day.&nbsp; The operation
produced violent retching in the Capitoline stomach.&nbsp; And on the
ninth day, from his mouth, quite unarmed, sprang the twelfth muse.&nbsp;
The other goddesses were very disgusted; and even the gods declined
to have any communication with the new arrival.&nbsp; Apollo, however,
was more tolerant, and offered her an asylum on the top shelf of the
celestial library.&nbsp; Ever afterwards Musagetes used to be heard
laughing immoderately, even for a librarian to the then House of Lords.&nbsp;
Jupiter, incensed at this irregularity, paid him a surprise visit one
day in order to discover the cause.&nbsp; He stayed, however, quite
a long time; and the other deities soon contracted the habit of taking
their nectar into the library.&nbsp; With the decline of manners, the
twelfth muse began to be invited to dessert, after Juno and the more
reputable goddesses had retired.&nbsp; To cut a long story short, when
<!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>Pan
died, in the Olympian sense very shortly afterwards, all the gods, as
we know, took refuge on earth.&nbsp; Jupiter retired to Iceland, Aphrodite
to Germany, Apollo to Picardy, but the twelfth muse wandered all over
Europe, and found that she was really more appreciated than her sisters.&nbsp;
The castle, the abbey, the inn, the lone ale-house on the Berkshire
moors, all made her welcome.&nbsp; Finally she settled in Ireland, where,
according to a protestant libel, she took the black veil in a nunnery.</p>
<p>She is older than the chestnuts of Vallombrosa.&nbsp; Perhaps of
all the ancient goddesses time has chilled her least.&nbsp; Her unfathomable
smile wears a touch of something sinister in it, but she has a new meaning
for every generation.&nbsp; And yet for Aretino there was some further
magic of crimson on her lips and cheeks, lost for us.&nbsp; She is a
solecism for the convalescent, and has given consolation to the brave.&nbsp;
She has been a diver in rather deep seas and a climber in somewhat steep
places.&nbsp; Her censers are the smoking-rooms of clubs; and her presence-lamps
are schoolboys&rsquo; lanterns.&nbsp; Though held the friend of liars
and <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>brutes,
she has lived on the indelicacies of kings, and has made even pontiffs
laugh.&nbsp; Her mysteries are told in the night-time, and in low whispers
to the garish day.&nbsp; She lingers over the stable-yard (no doubt
called <i>mews</i> for that reason).&nbsp; Her costly breviaries, embellished
with strange illuminations, are prohibited under Lord Campbell&rsquo;s
Act.&nbsp; Stars mark the places where she has been.&nbsp; Sometimes
a scholar&rsquo;s fallacy, a sworn foe to Dr. Bowdler, she is Notre
Dame de Milet, our Lady of Limerick.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>But it is of her sister I would speak, the thirteenth sister, who
was created to keep the eleventh in countenance.&nbsp; She presides
over the absurdities of prose.&nbsp; She is responsible for the stylistic
flights of Pegasus when, owing to the persuasive eloquence of the Hon.
Stephen Coleridge, his bearing-rein has been abolished, and he kicks
over the traces.</p>
<p>It was the Elethian Muse who inspired that Oxford undergraduate&rsquo;s
peroration to his essay on the Characteristics of St. John&rsquo;s Gospel&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Furthermore, we may add that St. John&rsquo;s
Gospel <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>is
characterised by a tone of fervent piety which is totally wanting in
those of the other Evangelists&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and she hovered over the journalist who, writing for a paper which
we need not name, referred to Bacchus as</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;that deity whose identity in Greek and Roman mythology
is inseparably connected with the over-indulgence of intoxicating liquors.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are prose beauties, Elethian jewels, hidden away in Baedeker&rsquo;s
mines of pregnant information and barren fact.&nbsp; I know it is fashionable
to sneer at Baedeker, especially when you are writing little rhapsodies
about remoter parts of Italy, where you have found his knowledge indispensable,
if exiguous.&nbsp; You must always kick away the ladder when you arrive
at literary distinction.&nbsp; I, who am still climbing and still clinging,
can afford to be more generous.&nbsp; Let me, therefore, crown Baedeker
with an essayist&rsquo;s parsley, or an academic laurel, ere I too become
selfish, forgetful, egoistical, and famous.</p>
<p>In <i>Southern France</i>, 1891 edition, p. 137, you find&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>To the Pic de Nere, 3&frac34; hrs. from Luz, there and
back 6&frac12; hrs.; a delightful excursion, which can be <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>made
on horseback part of the way: guide 12, horse 10 fr.; <i>adders abound</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For synthetic prose you will have to go to Tacitus to find the equal
of that passage.&nbsp; No more is heard of the excursion.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
leave Luz by the Barege road,&rsquo; the text goes on to say.&nbsp;
Reflections and picturesque word-painting are left for Mr. Maurice Hewlett,
Mr. Arthur Symons, and Murray.</p>
<p>In <i>Southern Italy</i>, Baedeker yields to softer and more Virgilian
influences.&nbsp; The purple patches are longer and more frequent.&nbsp;
On page 99 we learn not only how to get to Baiae, but that</p>
<blockquote><p>Luxury and profligacy, however, soon took up their abode
at Baiae, and the desolate ruins, which now alone encounter the eye,
point the usual moral!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from the preface to the same guide we obtain this remarkable
advice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The traveller should adopt the Neapolitan custom of rejecting
fish that are not quite fresh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is certain educational works, popular in my childhood, that
have yielded the more exotic Elethian blossoms for my Anthology.&nbsp;
There are passages I would not willingly let die.&nbsp; In one of these
books general knowledge <!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>was
imparted after the manner of Magnall: &lsquo;What is the world?&nbsp;
The earth on which we live.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who was Raphael?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;How is rice made?&rsquo;&nbsp; After such desultory interrogatives,
without any warning, came Question 15: &lsquo;Give the character of
Prince Potemki&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sordidly mean, ostentatiously prodigal, filthily intemperate
and affectedly refined.&nbsp; Disgustingly licentious and extravagantly
superstitious, a brute in appetite, vigorous though vacillating in action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until I went to the University, a great many years afterwards, I
never learnt who Potemki was.&nbsp; At the age of seven he stood to
me for what &lsquo;Timberio&rsquo; still is for Capriote children.&nbsp;
My teacher obviously did not know.&nbsp; She always evaded my inquiries
by saying, &lsquo;You will know when you are older, darling.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Suspecting her ignorance, I became pertinacious.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I
am as old as you?&rsquo; was my ungallant rejoinder.&nbsp; I had to
write the character out a hundred times.&nbsp; Then one Christmas Day
I ventured to ask my father, who said I would find out about him in
Gibbon.&nbsp; But I knew he was not speaking the truth, because he laughed
in a nervous, peculiar way, and added that since I was so fond of <!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>history
I must go to Oxford when I was older.&nbsp; I loathed history, and inwardly
resolved that Cambridge should be my University.&nbsp; My mother admitted
entire ignorance of Potemki&rsquo;s identity; and on my sketching his
character (for I was proud of the knowledge), said he was obviously
a &lsquo;horrid&rsquo; man.&nbsp; His personality shadowed my childhood
with a deadly fascination, which has not entirely worn away; producing
the same sort of effect on me as an imaginary portrait by Pater.</p>
<p>In a semi-geographical work called <i>Near Home; or, Europe Described</i>,
published by Hatchards in the fifties (though my friend, Mr. Arthur
Humphreys, denies all knowledge of it), I can recall many stereos of
dialectic cast in a Socratic mould:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Q</i>.&nbsp; What is the religion of the Italians?&nbsp;
<i>A</i>.&nbsp; They are Roman Catholics.</p>
<p><i>Q</i>.&nbsp; What do the Roman Catholics worship?&nbsp; <i>A</i>.&nbsp;
Idols and a piece of bread.</p>
<p><i>Q</i>.&nbsp; Would not God be very angry if He knew the Italians
worshipped idols and a piece of bread?&nbsp; <i>A</i>.&nbsp; God IS
very angry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Augustine Birrell, if still interested in educational phenomena,
will not be surprised to learn that when I reached to man&rsquo;s estate
I <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>&lsquo;embraced
the errors of Rome,&rsquo; as my historical manual would have phrased
it.</p>
<p>I pity the child who did not learn universal history from Collier.&nbsp;
How tame are the periods of Lord Acton, the Rev. William Hunt, Froude,
Freeman, Oman, Round, even Macaulay, and little Arthur, beside the rich
Elethian periods of William Francis Collier.&nbsp; Not Berenson, not
Byron, not Beerbohm, have given us such a picture of Venice as Collier
in describing the Council of Ten:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The ten were terrible; but still more terrible were the
three inquisitors&mdash;two black, one red&mdash;appointed in 1454.&nbsp;
Deep mystery hung over the three.&nbsp; They were elected by the ten;
none else knew their names.&nbsp; Their great work was to kill; and
no man&mdash;doge, councillor, or inquisitor&mdash;was beyond their
reach.&nbsp; Secretly they pronounced a doom; and ere long the stiletto
or the poison cup had done its work, or the dark waters of the lagoon
had closed over a life.&nbsp; The spy was everywhere.&nbsp; No man dared
to speak out, for his most intimate companions might be on the watch
to betray him.&nbsp; Bronze vases, shaped like a lion&rsquo;s mouth,
gaped at the corner of every square to receive the names of suspected
persons.&nbsp; Gloom and suspicion haunted gondola and hearth!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is owing to Collier that I know at least one fact about the Goths
who took Rome, <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>&lsquo;having
reduced the citizens to feed on mice and nettles, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
546,&rsquo; a diet to which many of the hotel proprietors in the imperial
city still treat their clients.</p>
<p>But let <i>Bellows&rsquo; Dictionary</i>, a friend and instructor
of riper years, close my list of great examples and my theme.&nbsp;
The criticism is apposite to myself, and its only oddity&mdash;its Elethian
quality, if I may say so&mdash;is its presence in that marvellous miniature
whose ingenious author you would never suspect could have found room
for such portentous observations in the small duodecimo to which he
confined himself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Unaffected language is the inseparable accompaniment
of natural refinement; but that affectation which would make up for
paucity of thought by overstrained expression is a mark of vulgarity
from which no accident of social position can redeem those who are guilty
of it.</p>

<h2><!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>THERE
IS NO DECAY.</h2>
<p><i>A Lecture delivered in the Old Bluecoat School, Liverpool, on
February 12th, 1908</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In every age there is some question raised as
to its wants and powers, its strength and weakness, its great or small
worth and work; and in every age that question is waste of time and
speech.&nbsp; To a small soul the age which has borne it can appear
only as an age of small souls; the pigmy brain and emasculate spirit
can perceive in its own time nothing but dwarfishness and emasculation.&nbsp;
Each century has seemed to some of its children an epoch of decadence
and decline in national life and spiritual, in moral or material glory;
each alike has heard the cry of degeneracy raised against it, the wave
of emulous impotence set up against the weakness of the age.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Swinburne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the invention of printing, or let me say before the cheapening
of printing, the lecturer was in a more fortunate position than he is
to-day; because, if a learned man, he was able to give his audience
certain pieces of information which he could be fairly sure <i>some</i>
of his listeners had never heard before.&nbsp; The arrival in town or
city of Abelard, Paracelsus, or Erasmus, to take the first instances
<!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>occurring
to me, must have been a great event, the importance of which we can
scarcely appreciate at the present day.&nbsp; It must have excited our
forefathers, at least as much as the arrival of Sir Herbert Beerbohm
Tree in any large city, excites I imagine, all of us to-day.&nbsp; But
multiplication of books has really rendered lecturers, as instructors,
mere intellectual Othellos; their occupation is gone; the erudition
of the ages is now within reach of all; though educational books were
fairly expensive within living memory.&nbsp; You owe, therefore, a debt
of gratitude to the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i> for bringing
Encyclop&aelig;dias of all kinds into the range of the shallowest purse
and in contact with the shallowest heads in the community.</p>
<p>But in case your learned professors have not contributed all their
hidden lore and scholarship to the cheap Encyclop&aelig;dias, and still
allow their learning to leak out at lectures, you may have come expecting
instruction from me on some neglected subject.&nbsp; If that is so,
I must confess myself at once an impostor.&nbsp; I have no information
to give you.&nbsp; I assume your erudition to compensate for <!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>my
own lack of it.&nbsp; There are no facts which I might bring before
you that you cannot find stated more clearly in valuable manuals or
works of reference, if you have not mastered them already.&nbsp; There
is no scientific or philosophic theory which I might propound that you
could not hear with greater benefit from others.</p>
<p>Briefly, I have no orange up my sleeve.</p>
<p>Let there be no deception or disappointment.&nbsp; I want you to
play with an idea as children play at ball&mdash;not football&mdash;but
the old game of catch.&nbsp; And out of this discussion, for I trust
that you will all differ, if not with me, at least with each other,
trains of thought may be quickened; mental grassland ploughed up; hidden
perspectives unveiled.&nbsp; Above all, I would stimulate you to an
appreciation of your contemporaries and of contemporary literature,
contemporary drama, and contemporary art.</p>
<p>Every few years distinguished men lift their voices, and tell us
that all is over, <i>decay has begun</i>.&nbsp; The obscure and the
anonymous echo the sentiment in the London Press.&nbsp; With the fall
of any Government its supporters prophesy <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>the
rapid decomposition of the Empire; in the pulpit eloquent preachers
of every sect and communion, thundering against the vices of Society,
declare that Society is breaking up.&nbsp; Of course, not being in Society,
I am hardly in a position to judge; and the vices I know only at second-hand&mdash;from
the preachers.&nbsp; Yet I see no outward signs of decay in Society;
it dresses quite as well, in some ways better than, it did.&nbsp; Society
eats as much, judging from the size and number of new restaurants; its
patronises as usual the silliest plays in London, and buys in larger
quantities than ever the idiotic novels provided for it.&nbsp; Have
you ever been to a bazaar in aid of Our Dumb Friends&rsquo; League?&nbsp;
Well, you see Society <i>there</i>, I can tell you; it is not dumb.&nbsp;
And the conversation sounds no less vapid and no less brilliant than
we are told it was in the eighteenth century; the dresses and faces
are quite as pretty.&nbsp; But much as I should like to discuss the
decay of English Society and the English nation, I feel that such lofty
themes are beyond my reach.&nbsp; I am concerned only with the so-called
decay of humbler things, the abstract manifestations <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>of
the human intellect, the Arts and Sciences.&nbsp; And lest, weary at
the end of my discourse, you forget the argument or miss it, let me
state at once what I wish to suggest, nay, what I wish to assert, <i>there
is no such thing as decay</i>.&nbsp; Decay is an intellectual Mrs. Harris,
a highly useful entity wherewith the journalistic Gamps try to frighten
Betsy Prig.&nbsp; Of course an obvious objection to my assertion is
the truism that everything has a life; and that towards the end of that
natural life we are correct in speaking of approaching decay.&nbsp;
With physical phenomena, however, I am not dealing, though I may say,
by the way, that there are many examples of human intellect maturing
in middle life or extreme old age.&nbsp; William Blake&rsquo;s masterpiece,
the illustrations to the Book of Job, were executed when he was sixty-eight,
a few years before his death.&nbsp; The late Lord Kelvin is an example
of an unimpaired intellect.&nbsp; Still, it must be admitted that while
nations may be destroyed by conquest, or by conquering too much and
becoming absorbed by the conquered, and that ancient buildings may be
pulled down or restored, so, too, conventions in literature and <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>schools
of art have been brought to an end by war, plague, or death&mdash;ostensibly
brought to an end.&nbsp; But it is an error to suppose that art or literature,
because their development was artificially arrested, were in a state
of decay.</p>
<p>The favourite object-lesson of our childhood was the Roman Empire.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s richness,&rsquo; as Mr. Squeers said, here was decline,
and Gibbon wrote his prose epic from that point of view.&nbsp; I hardly
dare to differ with the greatest of English historians, but if we approach
his work in the scientific spirit with which we should always regard
history, we shall find that Gibbon draws false deductions from the undisputed
facts, the unchallenged assertions of his history.&nbsp; Commencing
with the Roman Empire almost in its cradle, he sees in every twist of
the infant limbs prognostications of premature decline in a dispensation
which by his own computation lasted over fourteen hundred years.&nbsp;
It is safe enough to prophesy about the past.&nbsp; Everything I admit
has a life, but I do not consider old age decay any more than I think
exuberant youth immature childhood; death may be <!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>only
arrested development and life itself an exhausted convention.&nbsp;
Have you ever tried to count the number of reasons Gibbon gives (each
one is a principal reason) for the cause of Roman decline?&nbsp; His
philosophy reminds me of Flaubert&rsquo;s hero, who observed that if
Napoleon had been content to remain a simple soldier in the barracks
at Marseilles, he might still be on the throne of France.&nbsp; If we
really accept Gibbon&rsquo;s view of history, I am not surprised that
any one should be nervous about the British Empire.&nbsp; The great
intellectual idea of the Roman dominion, arrested indeed by barbarian
invasion, philosophically never decayed.&nbsp; Some of it was embalmed
in Byzantium&mdash;particularly its artistic and literary sides; its
religious forces were absorbed by the Roman Church, as Hobbes pointed
out in a very wonderful passage; its humanism and polity became the
common property of the European nations of to-day.&nbsp; Gibbon&rsquo;s
work should have been called &lsquo;The Rise and Progress of Greco-Roman
Civilisation.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is not such a good title, but it would
have been more accurate.&nbsp; And if you compare critically the history
of any manifestation of <!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>the
human intellect, religion, literature, painting, architecture, or science,
you will find that the development of one expressive force has been
momentarily arrested while some other manifestation is asserting itself
synchronously with the supposed decay in a manifestation whose particular
history you are studying.&nbsp; Always regard the deductions of the
historian with the same scepticism that you regard the deductions of
fiscal politicians.</p>
<p>Every one knows the charming books by writers more learned than I
can pretend to be, where the history of Italian art is traced from Giotto
downwards; the story of Giotto and the little lamb, now, alas! entirely
exploded; of Cimabue&rsquo;s Madonna being carried about in processions,
and now discovered to have been painted by some one else!&nbsp; Then
on to Massaccio through the delightful fifteenth century until you see
in the text-book in large print, like the flashes of harbour lights
after a bad Channel crossing, <span class="smcap">Raphael, Michael Angelo,
Da Vinci</span>.&nbsp; But when you come to the seventeenth century,
Guido Reni, the Carracci, and other painters (for the present moment
out of fashion), painters whose work <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>fetches
little at Christie&rsquo;s, the art critic and historian begin to snivel
about decay; not only of Italian art, but of the Italian peninsula;
and their sobs will hardly ever allow them to get as far as Longhi,
Piazetta, and Tiepolo, those great masters of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>But we know, painters certainly must know if they look at old masters
at all, that Tiepolo, if he was the last of the old masters, was also
the first of the moderns; it was his painting in Spain which influenced
Goya, and Goya is not only a deceased Spanish master, he is a European
master of to-day.&nbsp; You can trace his influence through all the
great French figure-painters of the nineteenth century down to those
of the New English Art Club, though they may not have actually known
they were under his influence.&nbsp; Painting commences with a childish
naturalism, such as you see on the walls of pre-historic caves; that
is why savages always prefer photographs to any work of art, and why
photographers are always so savage about works of art.&nbsp; Gradually
this childish naturalism develops into decoration; it becomes stylistic.&nbsp;
The decoration becomes perfected and sterile; then <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>there
arises a more sophisticated generation, longing for naturalism, for
pictorial <i>vraisemblance</i>, without the childishness of the cave
pictures.&nbsp; And their new art develops at the expense of decoration;
it becomes perfect and sterile.&nbsp; What is commonly called decay
is merely stylistic development.&nbsp; The exquisite art of Byzantium
was wrongly considered as the debasement of Greco-Roman art.&nbsp; It
was really the decorative expansion of it; the conventionalising of
exaggerated realism.&nbsp; The same might have happened in Europe after
the Baroque and Rococo fashions had their day; politics and commerce
interfered.&nbsp; The intensely artificial painting of France, to which
Diderot objected so much, had become perfect and sterile.&nbsp; Then
(happily or unhappily, in whichever direction your tastes lie) the French
Revolution, by a pathetic misunderstanding of classical ideals, paved
the way for the naturalism of the misnamed Romantic school.&nbsp; We
were told, a short time ago, that Sienese painting anticipated by a
few years the Florentine manifestations of Cimabue and Giotto, but Mr.
Berenson has pointed out that Sienese art is not the beginning but the
<!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>end
of an exquisite convention, the quintessence of Byzantium.&nbsp; In
the Roscoe collection at Liverpool you have one of the most superb and
precious examples of this delicate, impeccable and decadent art: &lsquo;Christ
found in the Temple,&rsquo; by Simone di Martini.</p>
<p>In Egyptian art, again, compare the pure naturalism of the wonderful
Egyptian scribe of the Louvre, belonging, I am told, to the fifth or
sixth dynasty, with the hieratic and conventional art of the twelfth
dynasty; while in the eighteenth dynasty you get a reversion to realism,
which critics have the audacity to call a &lsquo;revival of art.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But you might just as well call it decayed, as indeed they do call some
of the most magnificent Ptolem&aelig;an remains, simply because they
happen to belong to a certain date which, by Egyptian reckoning, may
be regarded as very recent.&nbsp; Just now we very foolishly talk in
accents of scorn about the early Victorian art, of which I venture to
remind you Turner was not the least ornament.&nbsp; Of course commercial
and political events often interrupt the gestation of the arts, or break
our idols in pieces.&nbsp; Another generation picks up the fragments
and <!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>puts
them together in the wrong way, and that is why it is so confusing and
interesting; but there is no reason to be depressed about it.&nbsp;
Only iconoclasm need annoy us.&nbsp; In histories of English literature
too often you find the same attitude when the writer comes to a period
which he dislikes.&nbsp; Restoration Comedy is often said to be a period
of debasement, and with Tennyson the young student is given to understand
that English literature ceased altogether.&nbsp; But perhaps there are
more modern text-books where the outlook is less gloomy.&nbsp; If, instead
of reading the history of literature, you read the literature itself,
you will find plenty of instances of writers at the most brilliant periods
complaining of decay.</p>
<p>George Putman, in the <i>Art of English Poesy</i>, published in 1589,
when English poetry was starting on a particularly glorious period,
says, &lsquo;In these days all poets and poesy are despised, they are
subject to scorn and derision,&rsquo; and &lsquo;this proceeds through
the barbarous ignorance of the time&mdash;in <i>other ages it was not
so</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then Jonson, in his &lsquo;Discoveries,&rsquo;
lamenting the decline of literature, <!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>says,
&lsquo;It is the disease of the age, and no wonder if the world, growing
old, begins to be infirm.&rsquo;&nbsp; There are hundreds of others
which will immediately occur to you, from Chaucer to Tennyson, though
Pope made noble protests on behalf of his contemporaries.&nbsp; You
have only got to compare these lachrymose observations with the summary
of the year&rsquo;s literature in any newspaper&mdash;&lsquo;literary
output&rsquo; is the detestable expression always used&mdash;and you
will find the same note of depression.&nbsp; &lsquo;The year has not
produced a single masterpiece.&nbsp; Glad as we have been to welcome
Mr. Blank&rsquo;s verse, &ldquo;Larkspurs&rdquo; cannot be compared
with his first delicious volume, &ldquo;Tealeaves,&rdquo; published
thirty years ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then turn to the review in the same paper
of &lsquo;Tealeaves&rsquo; thirty years ago.&nbsp; &lsquo;Coarse animalism
draped in the most seductive hues of art and romance, we will not analyse
these poems, we will not even pretend to give the reasons on which our
opinion is based.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or read the incisive &lsquo;Musings without
Method,&rsquo; in <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, on contemporary
literature and contemporary things generally.</p>
<p>Again, every painter is told that his work <!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>is
not as good as last year, and that we have no one like Titian or Velasquez.&nbsp;
The Royal Academy is always said to be worse than usual.&nbsp; I have
known the summer exhibitions at Burlington House for twenty years.&nbsp;
Let me assure you throughout that period they have always been quite
as bad as they are now.&nbsp; But we do not want painters like Titian
or Velasquez; we want something else.&nbsp; If painters were like Titian
or Velasquez they would not be artists at all.&nbsp; When Velasquez
went to Rome he was told he ought to imitate Raphael; had he done so
should we regard him as the greatest painter in the world?&nbsp; If
Rossetti had merely been another Fra Angelico or one of the early artists
from whom he derived such noble inspiration, should we regard him as
we do, as even the fierce young modern art student does, as one of the
greatest figures in English art of the nineteenth century?&nbsp; In
the latter part of that century I think he is the greatest force in
English painting.&nbsp; I would reserve for him the largest print in
my manual of English art.&nbsp; But have we declined since the death
of Rossetti?&nbsp; On the contrary, I think we have advanced and are
<!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>advancing.&nbsp;
You must not think I am depreciating the past.&nbsp; The past is one
of my witnesses.&nbsp; The past was very like our present; it nearly
always depreciated itself intellectually and materially.</p>
<p>We all of us think of Athens in the fifth century as a golden period
of great men, when every genius was appreciated, but you know that they
put Pheidias in prison.&nbsp; And take the instance of Euripides.&nbsp;
The majority of his countrymen said he was nothing to the late Aeschylus.&nbsp;
He was chiefly appreciated by foreigners, as you will remember if you
are able to read &lsquo;Balaustion&rsquo;s Adventure&rsquo; (so much
more difficult than Euripides in the original Greek).&nbsp; Listen to
what Professor Murray says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>His contemporary public denounced him as dull, because
he tortured them with personal problems; as malignant, because he made
them see truths they wished not to see; as blasphemous and foul-minded,
because he made demands on their religious and spiritual natures which
they could neither satisfy nor overlook.&nbsp; They did not know whether
he was too wildly imaginative or too realistic, too romantic or too
prosaic, too childishly simple or too philosophical&mdash;Aristophanes
says he was all these things at once.&nbsp; They only knew that he made
<!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>them
angry and that they could not help listening to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does not that remind you a little of what was said all over England
of Mr. Bernard Shaw?&nbsp; Of what is still said about him in many London
houses to-day?&nbsp; If some one praises him, the majority of people
will tell you that he is overrated.&nbsp; Does it not remind you of
the reception which Ibsen&rsquo;s plays met when they were first produced
here: when they gave an impetus to that new English drama which I understand
is decaying, though it seems to me to be only beginning&mdash;the new
English Drama of Mr. Granville Barker, Mr. Housman, Mr. Arnold Bennett,
Mr. Galsworthy, and Mr. Masefield?</p>
<p>Every year the patient research of scholars by the consultation of
original documents has caused us to readjust our historical perspective.&nbsp;
Those villains of our childhood, Tiberius, Richard III., Mary Tudor,
and others, have become respectable monarchs, almost model monarchs,
if you compare them with the popular English view of the present King
of the Belgians, the ex-Sultan of Turkey, and the present Czar of Russia.&nbsp;
It is realised <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>that
contemporary journalism gave a somewhat twopence coloured impression
of Kings and Queens, who were only creatures of their age, less admirable
expressions of the individualism of their time.&nbsp; And just as historical
facts require readjustment by posterity, so our critical estimate of
intellectual and &aelig;sthetic evolution requires strict revision.&nbsp;
We must not accept the glib statement of the historian, especially of
the contemporary historian, that at certain periods intellectual activity
and artistic expression were decaying or did not exist.&nbsp; If a convention
in one field of intellectual activity is said by the historian or chronicler
to be approaching termination or to be decaying, as he calls it, we
should test carefully his data and his credentials.&nbsp; But, assuming
he is right, there will always be found some compensating reaction in
another sphere of intellectual activity which is in process of development;
and through which, by some divine alchemy, providence, or nature, call
it what you will, a new manifestation will be made to the world.&nbsp;
The arts which we suppose to have perished, of which, indeed, we write
affecting epitaphs, are merely hibernating; <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>the
intellect which is necessary for their production and nutrition is simply
otherwise employed; while, of course, you must make allowances for the
appreciations of posterity, change of fashion and taste.&nbsp; From
the middle of the sixteenth century down to nearly the middle of the
nineteenth, the Middle Ages were always thought of as the Dark Ages.&nbsp;
Scarcely any one could appreciate either the pictorial art or architecture
of medi&aelig;valism; those who did so always had to apologise for their
predilection.&nbsp; The wonders of Gothic art were furtively relished
by a few antiquaries; and, at certain periods, by men like Beckford
and Walpole, as agreeable drawing-room curiosities.&nbsp; The Romantic
movement commenced by Chatterton enabled us to revise a limited and
narrow view, based on insufficient information.&nbsp; It was John Ruskin,
in England, who made us see what a splendid heritage the Middle Ages
had bequeathed to us.&nbsp; Ruskin and his disciples then fell into
the error of turning the tables on the Renaissance, and regarded everything
that deviated from Gothic convention as <i>debased</i>; the whole art
of the eighteenth century <!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>was
anathema to them.&nbsp; The decadence began, according to Ruskin, with
Raphael.&nbsp; Out of that ingenious error, or synchronous with it,
began the brilliant movement of the Pre-Raphaelites in the middle of
the last century.&nbsp; And when the Pre-Raphaelites appeared, every
one said the end of Art had arrived.&nbsp; Dickens openly attacked them;
Thackeray ridiculed the new tendencies; every one, great and small,
spoke of decay and decline.&nbsp; The French word <i>D&eacute;cadence</i>
had not crept into use.&nbsp; However, the weary Titan staggered on,
as Matthew Arnold said, and when Mr. Whistler&rsquo;s art dawned on
the horizon, Ruskin was among the first to see in it signs of decay.&nbsp;
Except the poetry of Swinburne, never has any art met with such abuse.&nbsp;
An example of the immortal painter now adorns the National Gallery of
<i>British</i> painting, which is cared for&mdash;oh, irony of circumstances&mdash;by
one of the first prophets of impressionism in this country, or, rather,
let me say, one of the first English critics&mdash;Mr. D. S. MacColl.</p>
<p>But you will now ask how do I account for those periods when apparently
the liberal arts <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>are
supposed not to have existed?&nbsp; I maintain they did exist, or that
human intellect was otherwise employed.&nbsp; The excavations of prehistoric
cities are evidences of my contention.&nbsp; Because things are destroyed
we must not say they have decayed; if evidences are scarce, do not say
they never existed.&nbsp; Our architecture, for example, took five hundred
years to develop out of the splendid Norman through the various transitions
of Gothic down to the perfection of the English country house in Elizabethan
and Jacobean times.&nbsp; If church architecture was decaying, domestic
architecture was improving.&nbsp; <i>Architecture is, of course, the
first and most important of all the arts</i>, and when the human intellect
is being used up for some other purpose there is a temporary cessation;
there is never any decay of architecture.&nbsp; The putting up of ugly
buildings is merely a sign of growing stupidity, not of declining intellect
or decaying taste.&nbsp; Jerry-building is the successful competition
of dishonesty against competency.&nbsp; Do not imagine that because
the good architects do not get commissions to put up useful or beautiful
buildings they do not exist.&nbsp; The history of <!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>stupidity
and the history of bad taste must one day engage our serious attention.&nbsp;
There is no decay, alas, even in stupidity and bad taste.</p>
<p>The suddenness with which the literature of the sixteenth century
developed in England has been explained, I know, by the Reformation.&nbsp;
But you should remember the other critics of art, who ascribe the barrenness
of our painting and the necessity of importing continental artists,
also to the Reformation.&nbsp; I suggest that the intellectual capacity
of the nation was directed towards literature, politics and <i>religious</i>
controversy, rather than to art and religion.&nbsp; I cannot think there
was any scarcity of the artistic germ in the English nation which had
already expressed itself in the great Abbeys and Churches, such as Glastonbury,
Tintern, Fountains, and York.&nbsp; And you must remember that the minor
art of embroidery, the &lsquo;<i>opus anglicanum</i>&rsquo; (which flourished
for three centuries previous to the Reformation), was famous throughout
Europe.</p>
<p>In the middle of the eighteenth century, the big men, Swift, Pope,
and Addison, having passed away, the Augustan age of English literature
seemed exhausted.&nbsp; It was a time <!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>of
intellectual dyspepsia; every one was much too fond of ruins; people
built sham ruins on their estates.&nbsp; Rich men, who could afford
the luxury, kept a dilapidated hermit in a cavern.&nbsp; Their chief
pleasure on the continent was measuring ruins in the way described so
amusingly by Goldsmith in <i>The Citizen of the World</i>.&nbsp; Though
no century was more thoroughly pleased with itself, I might almost say
smugly self-satisfied, the men of that century were always lamenting
the decline of the age.&nbsp; The observations of Johnson and Goldsmith
I need scarcely repeat.&nbsp; But here is one which may have escaped
your notice.&nbsp; It is not a suggestion of decline, but an assertion
of non-existence.&nbsp; Gray, the poet, the cultivated connoisseur,
the Professor of History, writing in 1763 to Count Algarrotti, says:
&lsquo;Why this nation has made no advances hitherto in painting and
sculpture it is hard to say; the fact is undeniable, and we have the
vanity to apologise for ourselves as Virgil did for the Romans:</p>
<blockquote><p>Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera,<br />
Credo equidem, vivos ducent de marmore vultus,<br />
Orabunt causas melius, coelique meatus<br />
<!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>Describent
radio, et surgentia sidera dicent:<br />
Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento;<br />
Hae tibi erunt artes; pacisque imponere morem,<br />
Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;You are generous enough to wish, and sanguine enough to see
that art shall one day flourish in England.&nbsp; <i>I too much wish,
but can hardly extend my hopes so far</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet in 1754
Chippendale had published his Cabinet Makers&rsquo; Guide; and the next
fifty years was to see the production of all that beautiful English
furniture of which we are so justly proud, and which we forge with such
surprising skill.&nbsp; It was the next fifty years that saw the production
of the beautiful English pottery which we prize so highly, and it was
the next hundred years that was to be the period of Reynolds, Gainsborough,
Lawrence, Crome, Cotman, Alfred Stevens, and Turner, who died in 1851,
just when the Pre-Raphaelites were supposed to be inaugurating the decay
of that which Gray denied the existence, nearly one hundred years before.</p>
<p>Though the scope of my discussion is limited to literature and art,
it would be paltry to confine our inquiries within limited <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>horizons.&nbsp;
Painting and architecture, alas, are not the whole of life; the fine
arts are only the flowers of existence; they are useful as humanising
elements; but they are not indispensable.&nbsp; That vague community
among whom we arbitrarily place those with whom we disagree&mdash;the
Philistines&mdash;get on very well without them.&nbsp; But even Philistines
have to reckon with Religion and Science, and in a lesser degree with
Philosophy.&nbsp; That powerful trinity affects our every-day life.&nbsp;
Philosophy is so cloistered, so difficult to understand, that we seldom
hear of its decay; though we are constantly told that some branch of
science is being neglected, or owing to a religious revival that its
prestige is becoming undermined; its truths are becoming falsehoods.&nbsp;
I am not a man of science, not even a student, only a desultory reader.&nbsp;
Yet I suggest that, as was pointed out in the case of the fine arts,
certain branches of the divine scholarship, if I may call it so, may
be arrested temporarily in any development they may have reached.&nbsp;
Let us take medicine.&nbsp; Medicine is primarily based upon the study
of anatomy or structure&mdash;physiology&mdash;or the <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>scheme
of structure carried out in life; and upon botany and chemistry as representing
the vegetable and mineral worlds where the remedies are sought.&nbsp;
Anatomy soon reaches a finite position, when a sufficient number of
careful dissections has been made; the other divisions used to look
like promising endless development; but there is reason to suppose that
they too, as far as medicine is concerned, have reached a sterile perfection.</p>
<p>The microscope is perfected up to a point which mechanicians think
cannot be improved upon; so that those ultimate elements of physiology
which depend upon the observation of minute structure are known to us.&nbsp;
To put it crudely, we cannot discover any more germs, whose presence
is hidden from us by mere minuteness, unless we can improve our machinery,
and that, we are told, is an improbable event.&nbsp; I will not labour
the point by applying it to botany, which is very obvious, or to chemistry,
where it is not so clear.&nbsp; But it <i>is</i> clear that owing to
a feeling that not much more is to be got from minute observation with
the tools at our disposal, the brightest intellects and most inventive
<!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>clairvoyant
work are shunted into more imaginative channels.&nbsp; There are no
men who guess so brilliantly as men of science, so that science, in
that respect, has attained the dignity of Theology.&nbsp; I suppose
that the startling theories propounded by Sir Oliver Lodge and others
will be taken as evidence of the decay of science.&nbsp; But the human
intellect, especially if it is scientific, cannot, I imagine, like actors,
go on repeating or feigning the same emotion.&nbsp; It must leave for
the moment as apparently completed one branch of knowledge to which
it may return again after developing some less mature branch on which
the attention of the most learned investigators is for a time wholly
concentrated.&nbsp; The tree of knowledge is an evergreen, and in science,
no more than in arts, is there any decay.&nbsp; When Darwin published
his great <i>Origin of Species</i> which was hailed as a revelation,
not only by scientific men, but by intelligent laymen, religious people
became very much alarmed.&nbsp; They talked about the decay of faith,
and ascribed any falling off in the offertories to the shillings spent
on visiting the monkey-house at the Zoological Gardens.&nbsp; <!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>Younger
sons and less gifted members of clever families were no longer destined
for Holy Orders; as we were descended from apes it would have seemed
impious.&nbsp; They were sent to Cambridge to pursue a so-called scientific
career, which was crowned by the usual &aelig;grotat in botany instead
of a pass in history.&nbsp; The falling off in candidates for Holy Orders
seriously alarmed some of our Bishops; and Darwin&mdash;the gentle,
delightful Darwin&mdash;became what the Pope had been to our ancestors.&nbsp;
I need not point out how groundless these fears happily proved to be.&nbsp;
The younger intellects of the country simply became more interested
for the moment in the cross-breeding of squirrels, than in the internecine
difficulties of the Protestant church on Apostolic succession, the number
of candles on the altar, and the legality of incense.&nbsp; Now, I rejoice
to say, there is a healthy revival of interest and a healthy difference
of opinion on all these important religious questions.&nbsp; We must
never pay serious attention to the alarmists who tell us that the churches
and sects are seeing their last days.&nbsp; Macaulay has warned us never
to be too sanguine about the <!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Church
of Rome.&nbsp; The moments of her greatest trials produced some of her
greatest men&mdash;Ignatius Loyola, Philip Neri, and Francis Xavier.&nbsp;
Do you think the Church is decaying because the congregations are banished
from France, and the Concordat has come to an end?&nbsp; I tell you
it will only stimulate her to further conquests; it is the beginning
of a new life for the Catholic Church in France.&nbsp; If the Anglican
Church were to be disestablished to-morrow, I would regard it as a Sandow
exercise for the hardworking, splendid intellects of the Establishment.&nbsp;
The Nonconformists&mdash;well, they never talk about their own decline;
of all the divisions of Christianity they always seem to me heartily
to enjoy persecution; and like myself, I never knew them to admit the
word <i>d&eacute;cadence</i> into their vocabulary, at least about themselves.&nbsp;
I hold them up to you as examples.&nbsp; Let us all be Nonconformists
in that respect.</p>
<p>I do not ask you to adopt the habit against which Matthew Arnold
directed one of his witty essays, the habit of expressing a too unctuous
satisfaction with the age and time in which we are living.&nbsp; That
was the <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>intellectual
error of the Eighteenth Century.&nbsp; There are problems of poverty,
injustice, disease, and unhappiness, which should make the most prosperous
and most selfish of us chafe; but I do urge that we should not suspect
the art and literature of our time, the intellectual manifestations
of our age, whether scientific or literary.&nbsp; I urge that we do
not sit on the counter in order to cry &lsquo;stinking fish,&rsquo;
and observe that this is merely an age of commerce.&nbsp; An overweening
modesty in us seems to persuade us that it is quite impossible we should
be fortunate enough to be the contemporaries of great men.&nbsp; The
fact that we know them personally sometimes undermines our faith; contemporary
contempt for a great man is too often turned on the contemporaries.&nbsp;
Do not let us look upon genius, as Schopenhauer accused some people
of doing, &lsquo;as upon a hare which is good to eat when it has been
killed and dressed up, but so long as it is alive only good to be shot
at.&rsquo;&nbsp; And if our intellectuals are not all Brobdingnagians,
they are not all Liliputians.&nbsp; It seems to me ungenerous to make
sweeping and deprecating assertions about our own time; it is also dangerous.&nbsp;
<!-- page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>The
contemporary praise of unworthy work, ephemeral work&mdash;there is
always plenty of that, we know&mdash;is forgotten; and (though it does
not decay) perishes with the work it extolled.&nbsp; But unsound criticism
and foolish abuse of great work is remembered to the confusion of the
critics.&nbsp; Think of the reception accorded to Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Byron, Keats, Shelley, Rossetti, and Swinburne.</p>
<p>I remember that excellent third-rate writer, W. E. H. Lecky, making
a speech at a dinner of the Authors&rsquo; Society, in which he said
that he was sorry to say there were no great writers alive, and no stylists
to compare with those who had passed away.&nbsp; A few paces off him
sat Walter Pater, George Meredith, and Mr. Austin Dobson.&nbsp; Tennyson,
though not present at the banquet, was president of the Society, and
Ruskin was still alive.&nbsp; When Swinburne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Atalanta
in Calydon&rsquo; appeared, another third-rate writer, James Russell
Lowell, assured the world that its author was no poet, because there
was no thought in the verse.&nbsp; Four years ago, at a provincial town
in Italy, when one of the Italian ministers, at the opening of some
public <!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>building,
said that united Italy owed to the great English poet Swinburne a debt
which it could never forget, the inhabitants cheered vociferously.&nbsp;
This was no idle compliment; every one in Italy knows who Swinburne
was.&nbsp; I will not hazard to guess the extent of the ovation which
the names of Lowell and Lecky would receive, but I think the incident
is a fair sign that English poetry has not decayed.</p>
<p>In the <i>Daily Mail</i> I saw once an interview with an inferior
American black-and-white draughtsman at Berlin.&nbsp; He was asked his
opinion about a splendid exhibition of old English pictures being held
there, and took occasion to say &lsquo;what the pictures demonstrate
is not that the English women of the eighteenth century were conspicuously
lovely, but the artists who painted them possessed secrets of reproduction
which posterity has failed to inherit.&rsquo;&nbsp; I would like to
reply &lsquo;Rot, rot, rot;&rsquo; but that would imply a belief in
decay.&nbsp; I suggest to the same critic that he should visit one of
the &lsquo;International Exhibitions,&rsquo; where he will see the pictures
of Mr. Charles Hazelwood Shannon.&nbsp; Such a stupid view from an <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>American
is particularly amazing, because in Mr. John Singer Sargent, we (by
<i>we</i> I mean America and ourselves) possess an artist who is certainly
the peer of Gainsborough and Reynolds, and personally I should say a
much greater painter than Reynolds.&nbsp; A hundred years hence, perhaps
people at Berlin (the most critical and cultivated capital in the world)
will be bending before the &lsquo;Three Daughters of Percy Wyndham,&rsquo;
the &lsquo;Duchess of Sutherland,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Marlborough Family,&rsquo;
and many another masterpiece of Mr. Sargent and Mr. Charles Shannon.&nbsp;
The same American critic says that our era of mediocrity will continue;
so I am full of hope.&nbsp; Even the existence of America does not depress
me: nor do I see in it a symptom of decay; if it produces much that
is distasteful in the way of tinned meat, it gave us Mr. John Sargent
and Mr. Henry James, and it took away from England Mr. Richard Le Gallienne.</p>
<p>I should be the last to invite you not to discriminate about the
present.&nbsp; We must be cautious in estimating the very popular writers
or painters of our time; but we must not <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>dismiss
them because they are popular.&nbsp; We should be tall enough to worship
in a crowd.&nbsp; Let our criticism be aristocratic, our taste fastidious,
and let our sympathies be democratic and catholic.&nbsp; Dickens, I
suppose, is one of the most popular writers who ever lived, and yet
he is part of the structure of our literature; but as Dickens is dead,
I prefer to mention the names of three living writers, who are also
popular, and have become corner-stones of the same building&mdash;Mr.
Thomas Hardy, Mr. Rudyard Kipling, Mr. H. G. Wells.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
are at all times,&rsquo; says Schopenhauer, &lsquo;two literatures in
progress running side by side, but little known to each other; the one
real, the other only apparent.&nbsp; The former grows into permanent
literature: it is pursued by those who live <i>for</i> science or poetry.&nbsp;
The other is pursued by those who live <i>on</i> science or poetry;
but after a few years one asks where are they? where is the glory that
came so soon and made so much clamour?&rsquo;&nbsp; We are happy if
we can discriminate between those two literatures.</p>
<p>While we should remember that there are at all times intellects whose
work is <!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>more
for posterity than for the present; work which appeals, perhaps, only
to the few, that of artists whose work has no purchasers, writers whose
books may have publishers but few readers, we must be cautious about
accepting the verdict of the dove-cot.&nbsp; There are many obscure
artists and writers whose work, though admired by a select few, remains
very properly obscure, and will always remain obscure; it is of no value
intellectually; the world should know nothing of its inferior men.&nbsp;
Sometimes, however, it is these inferior men who are able to get temporary
places as critics, and inform us in leading articles that ours is an
age <i>of Decadence</i>.&nbsp; Every new drama, every work of art which
possesses individuality or gives a fresh point of view or evinces development
of any kind, is held up as an instance of Decay.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>L&rsquo;&eacute;cole
d&eacute;cadent</i>&rsquo; was a phrase invented as a jest in 1886,
I believe by Monsieur Bourde, a journalist in Paris.&nbsp; It was eagerly
adopted by the Parisians, and soon floated across the Channel.&nbsp;
Used as a term of reproach, it was accepted by the group of poets it
was intended to ridicule.&nbsp; I need not remind you that the master
of that school <!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>was
Paul Verlaine, the immortal poet who enlarged the scope of French verse&mdash;the
poet who achieved for French poetry what I am told the so-called decadent
philosopher Nietzsche has done for German prose.&nbsp; Unfortunately
I do not know German, and it seems almost impossible to add to the German
language.&nbsp; But Nietzsche, I am assured by competent authorities,
has performed a similar feat to that of Luther on the issue of his Bible.</p>
<p>When, therefore, we hear of decadence in literature or art, even
if we accept Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s definition of its symptom&mdash;&lsquo;<i>the
employment of an over-wrought technique</i>&rsquo;&mdash;we must remember
that Decadence and Decay have now different meanings, though originally
they meant the same sort of thing.&nbsp; An over-wrought technique is
characteristic of the decadent school of France, particularly of Mallarm&eacute;,
and some of our own decadents.&nbsp; Walter Pater and Sir Thomas Browne.&nbsp;
The existence of writers adopting an over-wrought technique, however,
is not (and Mr. Balfour would repudiate the idea) a sign of decay as
commonplace moralists would have us believe, <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>but
of realised perfection.&nbsp; Pater is the most perfect prose writer
we ever produced.&nbsp; The Euphuists of the sixteenth century were
of course decadents, and I think you will admit that they did not herald
any decay in our literature.</p>
<p>The truth is that men after a certain age, if not on the crest of
the waves themselves, become bored with counting the breakers, and decide
that the tide is going out.&nbsp; You must often have had arguments
with friends on this subject when walking by the sea.&nbsp; The water
seems to be receding; you can see that there is an ebb; and then an
unusually long wave comes up and wets your feet.&nbsp; Great writers
are guilty of a similar error without any intention of contriving a
literary conceit (as I suspect many a past outcry to have been).&nbsp;
Even Pater declared that he would not disturb himself by reading any
contemporary literature published by an author who did not exist before
1870.&nbsp; He never read Stevenson or Kipling.&nbsp; Now that is a
terrible state to be in; it is a symptom of premature old age; not physical
but mental old age.</p>
<p>The art of the present day is not architecture, <!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>painting,
or literature.&nbsp; It is the art of remaining young.&nbsp; It is the
art of life.&nbsp; It is a science.&nbsp; The fairer, the stronger,
the better sex&mdash;shall I call its members our equals or our superiors?&mdash;have
always realised this.&nbsp; Indeed, they have employed ingenious mechanical
contrivances for arresting the march of time or that physical decay
of which we are all victims.&nbsp; Sometimes they may be said to have
indulged in an over-wrought technique, which may be the reason why we
are told that every woman is at heart a decadent.&nbsp; Otto Weininger
certainly thought so.&nbsp; I have always regretted that the male sex
was precluded by prejudice from following their example.&nbsp; I regret
somewhat acutely the desuetude of the periwig.</p>
<p>So we can take an example from women&mdash;they are so often our
theme, let them be our examples in a symbolical sense.&nbsp; If we choose,
we too can remain young intellectually, sensitive to new impressions,
new impulses and new revelations, whether of science or art.&nbsp; The
Greeks of the fifth century, and even of the age of St. Paul, preserved
their youth by cultivating the superb gift of curiosity, delightful
anxiety <!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>about
the present and future.&nbsp; William Morris once described the Whigs
as careless of the past, ignorant of the present, and fearful of the
future.&nbsp; Whatever your politics are, do not be like the Whigs as
described by William Morris.&nbsp; Cultivate a feminine curiosity.&nbsp;
I used to be told the old story of Blue Beard as a warning against that
particular failing.&nbsp; I see in it a much profounder moral.&nbsp;
It is the emancipation of woman; and asserts her right, if not to vote,
at least to be curious.&nbsp; Her curiosity rid the world of a monster,
and in her curiosity we see the nucleus of the new drama.&nbsp; That
little blood-stained key unlocked for us the cupboard where the family
skeleton had been left too long in the cold; it was time that he joined
the festive board, or, at least, appeared on the boards: and now, I
am glad to say, he has done so; and he is called new-fangled.&nbsp;
Do not let us call things &lsquo;new-fangled.&rsquo;&nbsp; New-fangled
medicine probably saves fifty per cent. of the population from premature
death.&nbsp; Do not speak of the &lsquo;crudity of youth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Youth is sometimes crude.&nbsp; It is better than being rude.&nbsp;
It is an error to mock at the single <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>virtue
a possible offender may possess.&nbsp; I observe that men of science
remain younger intellectually, and even physically, than artists or
men of letters.&nbsp; I believe it is because to them science is always
full of surprises and fresh impressions.&nbsp; They know there is practically
no end to their knowledge; and that in the study of science there is
no decay, whatever they may detect in the crust of the earth or on the
face of heaven.&nbsp; They are never satisfied with the past.&nbsp;
They look to youth and its enthusiasms for realising their own dreams
and developing their own hypotheses.&nbsp; And as there are great men
of science to-day, so, too, there are great men of letters, great poets,
and great painters, some of whose names you may not have heard.&nbsp;
But when you do hear of them I beg of you not to regard any of them
as symptoms of decay, even if their technique is elaborate and over-wrought.&nbsp;
The <i>early</i> work of every modern painter is over-elaborate and
over-wrought, just as all the work of early painters is over-elaborate
and over-wrought.&nbsp; Do not greet the dawn as though it were a lowering
sunset.&nbsp; Listen, and, with William Blake, you may <!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>hear
the sons of God shouting for joy.&nbsp; If your mind is bent on decay,
read that neglected poet, Byron.&nbsp; He thought the romantic movement,
of which he became the accidental centre, a symptom of decay.&nbsp;
Read any period of history and its literature, and you will find the
same cry reiterated.&nbsp; When you have read an old book go out and
buy a new one.&nbsp; When you have sold your old masters, go out and
buy new masters.&nbsp; Aladdin&rsquo;s maid is one of the wronged characters
of legend. . . . Of the Pierian spring there are many fountains.&nbsp;
Yet it is a spring which never runs dry; though it flows with greater
freedom at one season than at another, with greater volume from one
fountain than some other.&nbsp; In the glens of Parnassus there are
hidden flowers always blooming; though, to the binoculars of the tourist,
the mountain seems unusually barren.&nbsp; You will find that youth
does not vanish with the rose, that you need never close the sweet-scented
manuscript of love, science, art or literature.&nbsp; In them youth
returns like daffodils that come before the swallow dares, and take
the winds of March with beauty: or like the snapdragons which <!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>Cardinal
Newman saw blossoming on the wall at Oxford, and which became for him
the symbol of hope.&nbsp; For us they may stand as the symbol of realisation
and the immortality of the human intellect, in which there has been
no decay since the days of Tubal Cain.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
